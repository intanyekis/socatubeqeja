Member Darryl “DMC” McDaniels broke the news during an interview with Rock the Bells, adding that their decision is definite.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Run-DMC is over,” the 58-year-old <a href=# rel=nofollow>told the outlet</a>. “The only way Run-DMC gets back together is if The Beatles get back together. Can that happen?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding “the final show that we are ever going to do is going to be at Madison Square Garden in April. It’s going to be the last episode of the documentary we’re doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1183240482.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DMC then implied that while he and Joseph “Rev. Run” Simmons are closing the curtains as a unit, they’ll continue to entertain fans through their individual endeavors. “Run-DMC’s last show ever. ‘Cause it’s time for Run to go be Paul McCartney and me to be John Lennon. We done did what we could do.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the former bespectacled rapper, their hometown farewell will include performances from a list of their peers and predecessors, including Ice-T and Wu-Tang Clan.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DMC went on to compare the accompanying documentary to HBO’s The Defiant Ones docuseries, which centered on the life, career, and legacy of Dr. Dre and music executive Jimmy Iovine.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He also says that while having the project be featured on Netflix is an option, they’re open to selling the documentary to whoever offers the biggest check. “We’re gonna do it with Netflix or to the highest bidder,” DMC said. “It’s going to be a live production. Run-DMC’s doing The Last Waltz at Madison Square Garden. Who wants to pay $100 million to own it?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-694279230.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tickets to the show will be open to the public.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Run-DMC are regarded as Hip-Hop icons and are considered the first rap group to crossover into the mainstream. Founded in 1983, the group consisted of McDaniels, Simmons, and Jason Mizell, better known as <a href=# id=auto-tag_jam-master-jay data-tag=jam-master-jay>Jam Master Jay</a>, and released several acclaimed and commercially successful albums throughout the ’80s and ’90s.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In October 2002, Mizell was murdered after being gunned down in his Queens studio due to a rumored beef over <a href=#>an alleged drug deal</a> involving the legendary spinner. Two suspects, Karl Jordan Jr. and Ronald Tinard Washington have since been<a href=#> arrested and indicted </a>for JMJ’s murder.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Jan. 21, which would’ve been Jam Master Jay’s 58th birthday, McDaniels and Simmons paid tribute to their late group-member on their official Twitter account. “A contriver of style, flare and all things cool. The band, the sound, the glue,” their tweet read. “Happy birthday to our brother Jason ‘Jam Master Jay’ Mizell! #ripjmj #yojay ‘THE BEST DJ IN THE US OF A!!’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6fCr3nDpppmnpmjrq15wqilnJ2iqXqlu8KupJ6mpJa%2FunmQa2ptb2JufneCjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
