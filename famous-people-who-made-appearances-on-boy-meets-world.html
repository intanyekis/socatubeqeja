For people of a certain age (30-somethings, that is), <a href=#>Cory, Topanga, Shawn, Eric, and the whole gang</a> feel almost like they were our friends rather than characters on our TV screens. From 1993 to 2000, we experienced our teenage years alongside them - middle school dances to college applications and everything in between. The show employed quite a lot of day players to fill out this world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>22 Things That Make No Sense About Boy Meets World</a></span></p><p>Guest stars frequently made appearances to portray crushes, bullies, classmates, and nagging teachers. While Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel stand out in memory, these guest stars probably aren’t taking up much of your brain space these days. But that’s about to change; here are 10 of the most famous people who made guest appearances on Boy Meets World.</p><h2 id=brittany-murphy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Brittany Murphy</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We’ll wait while you grab a box of tissues. The ‘90s was a busy decade for <a href=#>Brittany Murphy</a>, who passed away in 2009 at only 32 years old. Somehow between mega hit movies like </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Clueless </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Girl, Interrupted</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, she made time to appear in two Season 1 episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Boy Meets World </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>as Trini, Topanga’s awkward best friend. Trini is dorky, but charming, and her overeagerness to befriend Cory yields plenty of laugh lines. We remember you, Trini!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mena-suvari><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Mena Suvari</span></h2><p>Four years before she rose to international fame for her role in American Beauty, Mena Suvari appeared in Season 3 as Hilary, a cutie from another high school. Hilary courts Cory at a dance, thinking that he is Shawn, whose suave reputation is favored among girls. Most now remember her from her prominent roles in American Pie, Six Feet Under, Sugar and Spice, and American Horror Story, but Boy Meets World fans can say they knew her way back when.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Mena Suvari Been Up To Since American Pie?</a></span></p><h2 id=fred-savage><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fred Savage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was probably pretty easy for Fred Savage to get on the show, given that Ben Savage is his brother. Not that he needed the connection - the Golden Globe and Emmy-nominated lead actor of The Wonder Years&nbsp;was already a star in his own right. In Season 6, he plays a creepy professor who hits on Topanga and then lies about it. Later, he also directed two episodes of the show.</p><h2 id=rue-mcclanahan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rue McClanahan</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’s hard to see Rue McClanahan as anyone other than the lascivious Blanche Devereaux in</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> The</span></i><i><span style=font-weight:400>Golden Girls</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, but the ‘90s saw her playing many other roles, including Cory’s grandmother Bernice in Season 1 of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Boy Meets World</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Bernice is brash and ostentatious, showering Cory and his siblings with gifts and regaling them with promises of fun outings and big purchases. When she doesn’t follow through on her promises, Cory learns a difficult truth about his grandmother and her history of letting down Cory’s dad in the</span><span style=font-weight:400> same way.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jake-the-snake-roberts><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jake "The Snake" Roberts</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jake Roberts took his talents from the professional wrestling ring to the set when he guested in Season 4. Frankie, a gentle giant and a friend of Cory and Shawn’s, struggles to relate to his dad, a wrestler, because he doesn’t know anything about wrestling. Cory agrees to go with Frankie to his dad’s match, at which Jake “The Snake” Roberts, playing himself, is the opponent. Jake The Snake loses, but the delight of having a real professional wrestler on is a big win for the show.</span></p><h2 id=jennifer-love-hewitt><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jennifer Love Hewitt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Halloween episode</a> “And Then There Was Shawn” tops most fans’ lists of favorite episodes ever. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Jennifer Love Fefferman, a humorous and cheekily-named offshoot of herself. She and the main gang get trapped in the school with a killer on the loose, and even in a dire situation, she still finds time to make out with Will, who instantly forgets his previous accusation that she was the killer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt's Career From 1995 to 2020, In Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=phyllis-diller><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Phyllis Diller</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most Boy Meets World fans couldn’t have properly appreciated the star power of this guest at the time, but now might recognize her as one of the most prominent&nbsp;celebrities to ever make an appearance. Phyllis Diller was a&nbsp;juggernaut in the standup comedy scene at a time when men dominated the genre. She delighted as Madame Ouspenskaya, a fortune teller who offers Cory some troubling premonitions.</p><h2 id=dom-irrera><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dom Irrera</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is the kind of guest appearance that would pique your dad’s interest as he walked through the living room while you were watching </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Boy Meets World</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. The comedian captured fans throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s with material about growing up in a multigenerational Italian-American family. True to his act, Dom played Bosco Cellini, Topanga’s “Italian” hair stylist. Sean calls Bosco out for what he knows is a fake Italian accent, and Bosco switches instead to a heavy Brooklynite accent, to hilarious effect.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leisha-hailey><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Leisha Hailey</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now we know her as Alice, the snappy bisexual in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The L Word</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and its recent reboot, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The L Word: Generation Q</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, but </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Boy Meets World</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was actually <a href=#>Leisha Hailey’s television debut</a>. She played Corinna, a struggling musician and a girlfriend of Eric’s. The episode made good use of Leisha’s guitar skills; she also has an impressive music career as part of pop groups The Murmurs and Uh Huh Her.</span></p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Candace Cameron Bure</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>...or “DJ,” as you more likely know her. The former Full House star is now known for her wholesome image, but she didn’t always play squeaky clean characters. “The Witches of Pennbrook” featured her as a <a href=#>lustful, Satan-worshipping witch</a> who throws herself at Jack. Maybe this character helped Candace Cameron Bure get an evil streak out of her system before returning to the conservative image she holds today.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Sweet Facts From The Set of Boy Meets World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqWfqsBuvMSop6WdXay1sHnMmpueZZGlvaat0ZqlnJ2jYryvecGosGallZrBtHnWqKmlnF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
