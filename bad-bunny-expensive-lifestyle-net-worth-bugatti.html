Sure, there are other musicians who are worth more, but considering the hype the Bad Bunny generates on a regular basis, we imagine that this number will only continue to rise.</p><p>As we mentioned already, Bad Bunny effectively conquered the world of music and became one of the hottest names on the globe. Even before turning into a global superstar, the man was generating some serious tour revenue back in 2018, when his La Nueva Religión Tour Part I and Part II hauled in more than $16 million worldwide, according to Billboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bad Bunny is at the top of his game, and his bank account reflects that.

Well, we may not have a detailed rap sheet of every little thing that he has gotten his hands on, but one thing we do know is that Bad Bunny has shelled out some of his cash on cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hola</a>, "After posting photos next to a modest Toyota Corolla, the international superstar revealed that he bought the 2003 model after trading in his exclusive Bugatti Chiron Sports 110 Ans, which is valued at almost $4 million. He bought the later to make an appearance at the 2020 Grammy Awards, and since then, he’s decided to take a more modest route with his vehicle choice."</p><p>Yes, he swapped it out, but we cannot simply brush past the fact that the man dropped a whopping $4 million on a single car. It is, however, interesting to see that he went so far in the other direction with the 2003 Corolla.</p><p>The performer detailed why he made the trade, saying, "At heart, I didn’t know what to do with the car, because I brought it to Puerto Rico and it was a piece of paper to guide it, everything was a problem: insurance, the government, taxes. Now, I have it in the United States. Here, I could not have it for another minute because when I would make my way through the streets, they knew it was me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About How Bad Bunny Came Up With His Stage Name</a></span></p><p>After making a massive purchase like the $4 million Bugatti Chiron, fans will be keeping an eye on Bad Bunny to see if he walks down the luxury car path again in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Bad Bunny Teases New Music And Possible Collabs With BTS And Harry Styles' Vogue Cover</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpxdl8KvuthmnLGolaPAqsLEZqOinpWowbq4xGalnqxdrLyzwMdmma6fkanBqns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
