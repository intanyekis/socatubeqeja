It was constructed by Lürssen in 2003 and is one of the world's largest yachts. The current owner, Hong Kong real estate mogul Samuel Tak Lee, paid an undisclosed member of the UAE royal family a cool $1 billion for the boat. The 115-meter-long ship was named pelorious, from the Greek for large. Terence Disdale was responsible for the interior design, and Tim Heywood did the exterior.</p><p>Both of the boat's engines are made by Wärtsilä, and together they allow it to reach a top speed of 20 knots. Not visible from anywhere else on board is the main suite's adjoining private deck, one of the ship's most outstanding features. Pelorus has gone through many different owners over the years. Hollywood billionaire David Geffen once owned it; before that, a Saudi Arabian businessman sold it to Roman Abramovich.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=al-said-300-million>Al Said – $300 million</h2><p>The Al Said is owned by the Sultan of Oman and is the seventh longest in the world at over 159 meters, as reported by Boat International.

The yacht, named for the late Sultan of Oman Qaboos Bin Said Al Said, is rumored to have an unidentified member of the Omani royal family. Little information about its plush amenities is available, although its performance hall can fit a 50-piece orchestra.</p><h2 id=radiant-320-million>Radiant – $320 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lurssen launched this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end motor yacht</a> built in 2009.

The interior is similarly adorned with handmade mosaics of intricate patterns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=motor-yacht-a-527-million-formerly-known-as-topaz>Motor Yacht A+ – $527 million (formerly known as Topaz)</h2><p>Topaz has an overall length of 147 meters, a beam of 21 meters, and a gross capacity of 11,589.
