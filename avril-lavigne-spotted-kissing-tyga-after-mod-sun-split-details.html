The twosome held hands as they entered the the Mugler X<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b><a href=#><strong>Hunter Schafer</strong></a><b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>Party, with Lavigne rocking an oversized hoodie and knee-high leather boots. Tyga, for his part, donned a matching grey set with a black T-shirt. He accessorized the look with a cross necklace and sunnies.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The kiss comes just two weeks after Us Weekly confirmed her split from the 34-year-old rocker. The pair were together for over two years before calling off their engagement, with a source telling Us earlier this month that the duo <a href=#>were “estranged for months”</a> before officially pulling the plug on their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Avril-Seemingly-Dating-Tyga-294.jpg><p>Speculation that the “What the Hell” artist had moved on first sparked when Lavigne was seen out to dinner with Tyga&nbsp;in Los Angeles last month. &nbsp;The duo were spotted together again while arriving at a party held by <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>&nbsp;in the city of love on Wednesday, March 1.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">However, an insider told at the time that the two are “genuinely friends and nothing more,” adding that there was “no third party”<a href=#> involved in her and Mod Sun’s breakup</a>.</p><p>While the source shared&nbsp;that <a href=#>Lavigne and the “1970s” crooner were “on and off” for months</a> before calling it quits for good, Mod Sun’s rep alleged to&nbsp;Us at the time that the musicians “were together and engaged as of 3 days ago when Mod left for tour so if anything has changed that’s news to him.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The Minnesota native — who proposed to Lavigne in March 2022 — later took to social media to address the split. “In <a href=#>1 week my entire life completely changed</a>,” he captioned a February 28 Instagram post. “I just know there’s a plan for it all. I’ll keep my head up + always listen my heart, even when it feels broken.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">He added: “Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the “My Hippy” singer is healing while on tour, Lavigne is enjoying her time with Tyga across the pond. The pair may just now be connecting, but they have long since been tethered through their previous romances with the Jenner family. The “Sk8ter Boi” songstress, for her part, dated <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a> for two years until their split&nbsp;in 2012. An insider told Us at the time that the Hills alum, 39, broke up with the Canada native because he was “tired of always being her plus-one, and always going on tour with her.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Tyga, meanwhile, dated Brody’s sister<a href=#><strong> Kylie Jenner</strong></a> after the pair met at<a href=#><strong> Kendall Jenner’s</strong> </a>Sweet 16 birthday party. The “Taste” rapper claimed via Twitter in September 2014 that the two were “just friends” as romance rumors escalated amid their eight-year age difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2015, they confirmed their relationship when the Kyle Cosmetics founder turned 18, called it quits for good two years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaarqKeuW64wK%2BgoKaVYsCxu9OtnJ1lm57AtLXNoGStsZeWeqKy056pZqWfmXq0wc1mqqmkmal6pbHTmqClq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
