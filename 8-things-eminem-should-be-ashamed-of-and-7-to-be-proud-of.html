And if you are, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a> has made it perfectly clear that he would rather you aren't. In perhaps one of the most vocal moments of any celebrity, Eminem tore into #45 and his fan-base in the only way he knows how, a scathing rap.</p><p>Those who felt insulted by Eminem may be looking for reasons to shoot back at the controversial artist and trust us, there are some moments. Em's history is far from clean, including moments with the law and some of his actions nearly drove his famed former flame Kim to suicide.</p><p>Speaking of Kim, she's also not afraid to let her feelings be perfectly clear about how she thinks Em stacks up in the bedroom. And when you consider it doesn't land on the proud side of the list, she definitely isn't the kindest.</p><p>But Eminem is also one of the most recognized and respected artists in many people's eyes for a reason. Whether it's the awards to back up his talking, the records he has set or his relationship with his daughter Hailie, there are plenty of things that Eminem's fanbase needs to know about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are the 8 Things Eminem Should Be Ashamed About (And 7 He Should Be Proud Of)</p><h2 id=ashamed---he-doesn-t-remember-years-of-his-life><strong>Ashamed - He Doesn't Remember Years Of His Life&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Eminem has been very open in the past about his battles with addiction. And while that is something that could be commendable, the height of his addiction is still something that he may not be the proudest of.</p><p>In a past interview, Eminem admitted that his reliance on the sleeping drug Ambien had significantly altered his memory</p><p>"I don't know if you've ever taken Ambien, but it's kind of a memory-eraser. That sh*t wiped out five years of my life. People will tell me stories, and it's like, 'I did that?' I saw myself doing this thing on BET recently, and I was like, 'When was that?'</p><h2 id=proud---he-got-clean-with-the-help-of-elton-john><strong>Proud - He Got Clean With The Help Of Elton John</strong></h2><p>One of the perks of being famous may be that you get to hang out with other inspirational celebrities. Such is the case of Eminem who has a solid friendship with Elton John.</p><p>The two performed together in 2001 at the Grammy Awards in a moment that Eminem would hope could dispell some of the belief that he is homophobic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007 suffered from an addiction to methadone that put him on the brink of death. When battling it, Elton was one of his closest friends. It was reported that they talked at least once a week on the phone.</p><h2 id=ashamed---terrible-at-you-know><strong>Ashamed - Terrible At...You Know</strong></h2><p>Eminem has definitely said some incredibly awful things about his on-again, off-again relationship with Kim. But Kim perhaps dug even deeper into Eminem when she attacked him for his skills in the bedroom.</p><p>“He’s not very well endowed…. If you’re going to have s*x with Marshall, make sure you have a little blue pill, because otherwise, it does not work,” said Kim. That definitely isn't the kind of endorsement you want to hear. And when you consider an issue like that in the bedroom can sometimes be caused by a lack of confidence, we're sure hearing that isn't going to make Eminem feel too good about himself.</p><h2 id=proud---his-relationship-with-hailie><strong>Proud - His Relationship With Hailie</strong></h2><p>Eminem's relationship with Kim, Hailie's mother, is definitely strained at times. However, we're sure Eminem is proud of how much he loves his daughter. One of the best stories about Eminem is centered around when his daughter was named the homecoming queen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One parent at the event described Eminem's actions,</p><p>“Hailie came out with her mother Kim [Scott] when she was introduced with all the other kids but her father watched from inside the school because he didn’t want to cause a scene – he wanted Hailie to have her own moment. He opened the door and looked out like – ‘That’s my daughter!’ He just looked like a proud father."</p><h2 id=ashamed---his-education><strong>Ashamed - His Education</strong></h2><p>It is clear that in the world of music there aren't many people who can hold a candle to Eminem. But life could have ended up a lot worse for Eminem had he not made it in the industry as high school was not his scene.</p><p>It was reported that he failed the ninth grade on three separate occasions and did not end up completing his high school graduation and instead was working several jobs to help support his mother. Eminem was also frequently bullied during his younger years, something he used as inspiration in his music. While there were some tough times, it's clear that Eminem had the right idea to focus&nbsp;on music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=proud---first-rap-song-to-win-an-oscar><strong>Proud - First Rap Song To Win An Oscar</strong></h2><p>There are countless amazing songs that have been awarded an Academy Award for Best Original Song. But it wasn't until Eminem came along with "Lose Yourself" that a rap song was given the honor. The song was written for the movie 8 Mile which was based on his life.</p><p>While some people would consider the chance to go to an awards show like this a huge honor, Eminem skipped the show in favor of spending time watching cartoons with his daughter. While that's clearly a sign that he did not expect to win, it is also a cute story about how he chose a family moment as opposed to a Hollywood party.</p><h2 id=ashamed---when-he-punched-someone-for-kissing-his-wife><strong>Ashamed - When He Punched Someone For Kissing His Wife</strong></h2><p>There weren't many things about Kim and Eminem's relationship that was healthy. Including a moment on June 4th, 2000 when Kim was seen kissing another man, John Guerrera, in a parking lot.</p><p>Eminem confronted the two in what ended with a violent altercation and while it was not pulled out, Eminem did have a concealed weapon on him. Eminem received 2 years probation. Kim later attempted to kill herself on July 7th.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eminem also had an incident (on June 3rd, 2000 - talk about a bad week) in which he pulled out a gun during an argument with a car-audio store employee. He received 1-year probation from this incident as well as community service.</p><h2 id=proud---his-stance-on-lgbtq-matters><strong>Proud - His Stance On LGBTQ Matters</strong></h2><p>There have been some moments in Eminem's career where he has been at the center of controversy in the LGBTQ community. One of the biggest reasons being his usage of some slurs, such as f*ggot in some of his songs. But Eminem has defended himself saying,</p><p>"I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words."</p><p>Eminem has also come out in the past in favor of same-sex marriage, saying in an interview</p><p>"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable if they want."</p><h2 id=ashamed---the-effect-of-his-song-on-kim><strong>Ashamed - The Effect Of His Song On Kim</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eminem has no shortage of women that he has gone after in songs. But nobody may have received as much abuse as his high school sweetheart (as well as on-again, off-again wife), Kim.</p><p>In Eminem's hit song "Kim" from The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem writes about how much he would love to murder her. The popularity of the song made the pain all the deeper for Kim who later attempted to kill herself the same year of the song's release.</p><p>Considering the two have a child together (who at the time was being kept from Em, hence some of the anger), he may regret how raw he went with the track.</p><p>Even if he doesn't, anyone who's looking for a reason to hate on Eminem may find it with some of the lyrics.</p><h2 id=proud---rap-god-got-him-a-world-record><strong>Proud - Rap God Got Him A World Record</strong></h2><p>Eminem has had several amazing singles in his lengthy career, but his most impressive may be "Rap God" which came off of his 8th album The Marshall Mathews LP 2.</p><p>Released in 2013, the song ended up being awarded a Guinness Book of World Records award for most songs in a single rap song with 1,560. For anyone who ever wants to say Eminem doesn't have any originality, that's a pretty amazing card to throw right back into their face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about the song and the meaning behind it, Eminem described it as his attempts to write down and chronicle the journey that he has experienced as an artist.</p><h2 id=ashamed---his-relationship-with-his-mother><strong>Ashamed - His Relationship With His Mother</strong></h2><p>Eminem's relationship with his mother has been immortalized in several songs, and not always in the best ways. One of the most infamous songs that painted her in a negative light is "Cleanin' Out My Closet", but Eminem has since matured and apologized for how he treated his mother.</p><p>Though in Eminem fashion, it was through another song this time titled "Headlights" during which Em admits he won't play "Cleanin' Out My Closet" at concerts anymore.</p><p>Eminem's relationship with his mother is still described as estranged, but we're sure he's at least happy he got some of his regretful feelings down in a song.</p><h2 id=proud---he-won-a-lawsuit-against-deangelo-bailey><strong>Proud - He Won A Lawsuit Against DeAngelo Bailey&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are many people that Eminem has rubbed the wrong way over the years. But one person who took particular exception to Eminem was DeAngelo Bailey who Eminem knew as a teenager. The two had one altercation that left Eminem wounded, something he talked about in his song "Brain Damage".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bailey later sued Eminem to the tune of $1 million citing that the song portrayed him incorrectly. But as you know, Eminem not only won the lawsuit but the judge at the time read out the sentence in what was described a "rap-like rhythm." While the judge may not have been as talented as Eminem, we're sure he enjoyed the show!</p><h2 id=ashamed---when-he-threatened-the-president><strong>Ashamed - When He Threatened The President</strong></h2><p>No, not Trump, we'll spend time on this list making sure it's explicitly clear that Eminem has no issues with how he's handling #45. The moment we'll talk about here came in 2003 when a bootlegged version of a song was released featuring the lyrics</p><p>"(Expletive) money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead."</p><p>A spokesperson for Eminem quickly released a statement after it was reported that Secret Service was looking into the rapper,</p><p>"This was an unfinished song, either lost or stolen. There was no determination where, when, how or if it was going to be used."</p><h2 id=proud---his-rap-against-trump><strong>Proud - His Rap Against Trump</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no doubt about it that Eminem is proud of his recent "attack" on Donald Trump. For those who missed it, Eminem made his point perfectly clear when he ended it with</p><p>"I'm drawing in the sand a line: you're either for or against</p><p>And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split</p><p>On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:</p><p>F**k you!</p><p>The rest of America stand up</p><p>We love our military, and we love our country</p><p>But we f**king hate Trump"</p><p>He is far from the only celebrity to state his displeasure with how the American government is being run at the moment. And while the rap earned him plenty of scorn from people, he also definitely gained some fans through his actions.</p><h2 id=ashamed---the-controversy-with-michael-jackson><strong>Ashamed - The Controversy With Michael Jackson</strong></h2><p>Eminem has a great deal of respect for many of his fellow musicians. But in 2004 with the release of his album Encore, it appeared at least to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson</a> that he was not on good terms with Em.</p><p>The most popular song from the album "Just Lose It" featured several raps centered around Jackson and some of his more controversial moments including&nbsp;his infamous&nbsp;trial being parodied in the music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several celebrities were upset with Eminem including Steve Harvey who said</p><p>"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back."</p><p>The video was later banned on BET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZxZaSdtq%2Bz0macpqGemrpuv8eorKWcXZeybq3SoZimnZRivKd5wKebZm9dqbxursRmp6unpZl6sLKO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
