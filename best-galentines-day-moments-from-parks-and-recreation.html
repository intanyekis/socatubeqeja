It’s only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style,” Leslie explained during season 2, episode 16 of Parks and Rec, which first aired in 2010. “Ladies celebrating ladies. It’s like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_editorial_1633728f-1.jpg><p>Leslie made sure to <a href=#>give her BFFs thoughtful gifts each year</a>, including a “bouquet of hand-crocheted flower pens, a mosaic portrait for each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda and a personalized 5,000-word essay of why you are all so awesome.”</p><p>Poehler, meanwhile, revealed that she celebrates <a href=#>the special day with her own friends</a> — many of whom were on the NBC series.</p><p>“I’m having dinner after the show with <a href=#><strong>Rashida Jones</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kathryn Hahn</strong></a>,” the Massachusetts native revealed during a February 2020 appearance on <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> “I don’t think there has to be [gifts], but Leslie Knope did [give them].” (Jones played Ann Perkins, Plaza played April Ludgate and Hanh portrayed Jennifer Barkely on the series.)</p><p>The Inside Out actress noted that it “kind of caught on as a fun fake holiday, just like Valentine’s Day, which is also a fake holiday.”</p><p>After host <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> </a>proposed a male version of the holiday, Poehler quipped: “I feel like men are so sensitive now, you could have your own Galentine’s Day version of it.”</p><p>That same month, Poehler confirmed during an appearance on <a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> that she does “celebrate Galentine’s Day all the time.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> alum joked: “If you’re gay then every Valentine’s Day is Galentine’s Day.” <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> replied, “Women are a good time. Gay or not, it’s a fun time.”</p><p>Poehler added, “I think it’s fun to make up your own holidays.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Parks and Recreation aired for seven seasons from 2009 to 2015.
