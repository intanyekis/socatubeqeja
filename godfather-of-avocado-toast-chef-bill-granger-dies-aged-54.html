It’s too cruel.”</p><p>Granger began his career in 1993, after he dropped out of art school to open his first restaurant in Sydney when he was just 23 years old.</p><p>Bills – a sunny corner cafe – became renowned for simple dishes like avocado toast, ricotta pancakes with honeycomb butter, and top-quality coffee.</p><p>Its popularity exploded, and from there he opened more cafes in Japan, Korea and London, where he also created an offshoot chain called Granger & Co.</p><p>Australian chef Darren Robertson said Granger had “changed the entire breakfast game” while Masterchef Australia alumnus Adam Liaw described him as “arguably [the] most influential pioneer of modern Australian food”.</p><p>“His ‘sunny’… codification of Australian cafe culture at Bills is the model on which every Australian cafe around the world is now built. Bloody great guy, too,” Liaw wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Such was his impact that in January, Granger was recognised with the Medal of the Order of Australia – one of the country’s top honours – for his contribution to tourism and hospitality.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC in 2019, the chef reflected on the humble foundations of his breakfast empire.</p><p>“I’ve done all these extraordinary things, just from liking to cook pancakes and scrambled eggs, which is pretty amazing.”</p><p>Granger is survived by his wife and business partner, Natalie Elliott, and his three daughters, Edie, Inès and Bunny.</p><p>By BBC News</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57xqibn5mknbKzec6fZJqun5iupbuMraaaq6RisKmxxWaZoqScYrSzrc2gnKtllJ6ytHnAoJydZWVpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
