The streaming platform’s forthcoming <a href=#>reality series</a> The Perfect Match features a cast of familiar faces.</p><p>The dating competition show — which premieres on Valentine’s Day — features Netflix alumni from unscripted series including <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, <a href=#>The Circle</a>, <a href=#>Too Hot to Handle</a>, <a href=#>The Ultimatum</a> and The Mole. The 23 reality TV veterans will pair up into potential matches and compete to see which duo has the best connection.</p><p>At the end of each challenge, <a href=#>the most compatible couple</a> wins the power to <a href=#>play matchmaker</a> by breaking up existing duos to send them on dates with new singles who might be better suited for them.</p><p>“This is like <a href=#>The Hunger Games</a> for dating,” <a href=#><strong>Chase DeMoor</strong></a>, previously seen on Too Hot to Handle, quips in the trailer. The teaser shows a sneak peek at the type of games the pairs will play to win power, including kissing while blindfolded and wringing out a sponge by squeezing it between their bodies.</p><p>However, it’s not all fun and games. New singles will arrive at the Panamanian villa throughout the competition — and each time new faces arrive, the contestants must decide once again who their perfect match is. Anyone left without a partner at the end of the night is eliminated.</p><p>Netflix describes its newest reality TV fare — which is hosted by <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong> </a>— as an “over the top journey of strategy and dating.” While plenty of onscreen drama seems guaranteed, the series has already stirred up offscreen controversy. Love Is Blind alum <a href=#><strong>Natalie Lee</strong></a> claimed that her ex-fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Shayne Jansen</strong></a> — who will appear on The Perfect Match — began the casting process while they were still together.</p><p>“I knew about the new dating show back in Sept 2021 because Shayne and I were both approached to apply for it while we were in a relationship (casting didn’t know we were together at the time),” Natalie wrote via her Instagram Story in January. “We told each other we declined the opportunity, but I later found out he actually didn’t decline and <a href=#>started the casting process in Nov 2021 without my knowledge</a> at the time, while we were still together.”</p><p>Shayne, however, disputed the claims, sharing text messages via his Instagram Story that were seemingly from the consulting manager.</p><p>“I really <a href=#>want you to enjoy life</a> because this show for you is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Natalie allegedly wrote in one message.</p><p>The twosome got engaged while filming <a href=#>season 2 of </a>Love Is Blind, but Natalie called off their engagement at the altar. The pair gave their relationship another shot after the series wrapped, but later called it quits again.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We did continue our relationship for several months <a href=#>and we parted ways after that</a>,” Natalie exclusively told Us Weekly in March 2022. “But we are friends right now and I wish him all the best.”</p><p>Scroll through for everything to know about The Perfect Match:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ5z56pn52TqXqurdOcn2asopa2rbHRZpurp6CoerG%2BxKagnqqVYrGiwMRmmpqrpGK6sL7EaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
