She already has an existing lien for over $12,500 stemming from unpaid taxes in 2017. One thing the court filing doesn’t reveal is why Maci owes taxes to the state of California, considering she’s never owned property there, to the public’s knowledge.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Costner’s Ex Moves Into Staff Quarters, But Refuses To Leave $145 Million Estate</a></span></p><p><a href=#>The Ashley </a><a href=#>points out that Maci’s company, Bulletproof Enterprises</a>, has a mailing address in California’s Newport Beach, which could explain the tax issues.

In 2013, she faced a lien of over $78,000, only to receive another one or $5,300 two years later.
