After wowing the world in a Givenchy boatneck gown for her ceremony, <a href=# rel=noopener>Meghan Markle</a> switched into a <a href=# rel=noopener>Stella McCartney</a> halter dress for the evening reception at Frogmore House, a royal residence near Windsor Castle.</p><p>It was a slinkier and sultrier dress than her ceremony gown, which calls to mind the dress she one named as her favorite: <a href=# rel=noopener>Carloyn Bessette Kennedy’s iconic slip-style Narciso Rodriguez wedding dress</a>. The lighter-weight sleeveless frock will allow the Duchess of Sussex to celebrate among the 200 guests invited to the reception hosted by Prince Charles. She paired the white high-neck silk crepe frock with satin and nude mesh Aquazurra shoes that featured sweet baby blue soles (perhaps her something blue?).</p><p>On the Suits star’s finger was another blue clue: a giant emerald-cut aquamarine sparkler that bore a striking resemblance to a the ring Princess Diana wore in October 1996.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-ring.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dress2-meghan.jpg><p>In a slight change from the low center-parted updo by Serge Normant she wore with her crown and veil, she switched to a sleeker low bun with tendrils in front, this time by hairstylist George Northwood.</p><p>Her first dress revealed earlier this morning, designed by Givenchy artist director Claire Waight Keller, was made with a matte-finish double-bonded silk cady and featured six seams. With sleek lines and a structured silhouette it was chic, modern and completely elegant.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McCartney pulled out as a favorite to design one of her dresses yesterday, after whispers had favored one of her go-to designers, Ralph & Russo. The pick makes sense — not only is she a top British designer, but Stella, as the daughter of Paul McCartney, is a member of a different kind of royalty family.</p><p>Kate Middleton also had two dresses for her wedding to Prince William, the first her iconic lace dress and the second a simpler ivory satin gown with a furry stole. Both designs were by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KyqLTAp2SmmaKguaZ51p6Yq6tdqLKku82dZKunqZa5bsPEnZuippdisbOx0qxkm7FdqMGmuMuaZKabk5a%2FtbrEsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
