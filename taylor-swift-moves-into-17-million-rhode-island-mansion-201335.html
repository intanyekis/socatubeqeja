On Wednesday, May 1, just one day after reports indicated that she had paid more than $17 million in cash for an oceanfront mansion in Rhode Island, the "22" singer was spotted moving things into her new place.</p><p>Arriving via private plane in Watch Hill, R.I., with her parents and bodyguards, Swift, 23, quickly got to work making herself at home.

She reportedly toured the place on April 15 and then made a deal with the owners a short time later. Sources told TMZ the asking price for the 11,000-square-foot mansion was $20 million, but Swift got it for around $17.75 million.</p><p>Per Zillow, the seaside summer home is said to have been built in 1930.

As <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href=#>previously reported</a>, the singer "flipped" the seven-bedroom home for a nearly $1 million profit.</p><p>"It was like a house-flip," a source told Vanity Fair.
