What car was it?” After a bit of back and forth in which Victoria insisted “it’s not a simple answer” and “it depends,” she eventually admitted, “OK. In the ‘80s my dad had a Rolls Royce.”</p><p>The moment has made waves on social media, with many fans praising David for calling Victoria out.</p><p>“He humbled her real quick,” one wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “Gotta love their relationship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/David-Beckham-Calls-Victoria-Beckham-Out-for-Saying-Shes-Working-Class-In-Viral-Clip-Be-Honest-inline.jpg><p>“Like anyone was going to believe that Victoria Beckham was from a working class family,” another said on X. “Girl, bye!! You were not self-made and that is ok.”</p><p>“We don’t call her Posh spice for nothing,” a fan joked on TikTok.</p><p>In the same episode, David and Victoria recalled their <a href=#>first meeting at a football match</a> in 1997.</p><p>“I’d seen pictures of him in magazines and he’s obviously a really good-looking boy,” the former Spice Girl said. “The fact that I went to the games really was just to kind of…some would say ‘stalk’ him, I would say ‘see’ him. When I saw him in the footballers’ lounge, other footballers were at the bar but he was standing, talking to his parents. And I’m very close to my family and I loved that side to him…I just fancied him. It was as simple as that.”</p><p>“There was something there that just … straight away,” David reflected. “I was just like, ‘OK, this is it. And it’s gonna move fast.’”</p><p>The couple quickly became a global sensation and were dubbed “Posh and Becks” by the media. They married two years later in 1999 <a href=#>and share four children</a>: sons Brooklyn, 24, Romeo, 21, Cruz, 18, and daughter Harper, 12.</p><p>David and Victoria’s relationship has also had its ups and downs. In Beckham, they opened up about accusations that David <a href=#>had been unfaithful</a> after relocating to Madrid 2003. David denied any infidelity in a statement at the time.</p><p>“It was the hardest period [of our marriage] because it felt like the world was against us,” Victoria said. “Here’s the thing — we were against each other, if I’m being completely honest.”</p><p>In 2017, the couple faced rumors of an impending divorce, which they vehemently denied.</p><p>Beckham also brought to light the moment that <a href=#>David nearly missed the 2005 birth</a> of their third son, Cruz, because of a photo shoot with <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Seriously, I’m about to burst, I’m on bed rest. Are you kidding me?!’” Victoria said in the documentary. “You’ve got a damn photo shoot with Jennifer Lopez — who is gorgeous and not about to have a baby.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued, “I remember someone showing me the front page of the newspaper, which was a gorgeous picture of David between Jennifer Lopez and <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>, and the headline was, ‘What would Posh say?’ Let me tell you what Posh would say. Posh was pissed off!”</p><p>Beckham is streaming now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuarpmZeqOxwqSfmqVdmK6tuNJmpq6sXau2pMDOq6CaZZakv26%2FwLKgp59dqLWmedaaqmavn6e4qrrGZpqlmaOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
