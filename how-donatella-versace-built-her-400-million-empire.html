She had to go through difficult times during her childhood when her older sister Tina died at the age of twelve due to improperly treated tetanus infection which devastated the young Donatella. During the mid 1970s, Donatello decided to attend a school in Florence, Italy to study literature and languages which meant that she had to commute every weekend to Milan so that she could spend some time with her family. At an early age, she started developing her trademark look as she dyed her hair blonde and used a dark eyeliner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she finished studying, she planned to work for her brother who works at the public relations department and she did however she was more valuable to him as a muse and critic. With the closeness of her brother’s company to some other companies, she was able to enter the world of fashion. In 1989, Gianni <a href=#>decided to launch a fragrance </a>which was named Blonde to dedicate to Donatella. He also gave Donatella a label of her own called Versus in 1989 which was geared towards the younger audiences.

Since then, the brand has gained the so much prestige thanks to the skills and talent of Donatella. With the established popularity and influence of Versace in the fashion world, Donatella decided to sell about 20% stake in their company Versace to the equity firm Blackstone, this move has increased the value of the Versace company to roughly $1.4 billion overall with Allegra’s stake worth $700 million and Donatella’s stake worth $280,000.</p><p>In 2018, Donatella once again mediated a sale of their firm but this time, she decided to sell the entire firm<a href=#> to the Michael Kors Holdings</a>.
