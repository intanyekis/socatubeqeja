His high school days saw him actively engaged in the marching band and even as the starting quarterback for the football team, leading them to an East Valley League championship in 2014.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Capture-177.png alt=Blueface width=1576 height=887 data-sizes="(max-width: 1576px) 100vw, 1576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Blueface’s foray into the world of rap began in 2017 under the name “Blueface Bleedem,” a nod to the School Yard Crips street gang. His breakthrough came with the viral success of “Deadlocs,” a track born out of an impromptu rap battle during a friend’s recording session. This marked the genesis of Blueface’s unorthodox style and laid the foundation for his subsequent success.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Blueface_Las_Vegas_Lawsuit></span><strong>Blueface Las Vegas Lawsuit</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite his musical achievements, Blueface’s journey has been marred by legal troubles. In 2018, he faced charges related to a shooting incident at a gas station, followed by another arrest in 2019 for felony gun possession. However, the most significant legal episode unfolded in October 2022 when Blueface was arrested in Las Vegas on charges of attempted murder and shooting. He eventually pleaded and agreed to three years of probation, with the looming threat of a 2-5 year sentence if he violates probation during this period.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>Net Worth Of Ashley Judd</a></p><p>The aftermath of the Las Vegas incident included a $13 million lawsuit against Blueface. The owner of Euphoric Gentlemen’s Club, where the shooting occurred, was awarded $13,072,482, comprising $12.6 million for lost revenue, $200,000 in “lease damages,” and $84,000 in employee expenses.
