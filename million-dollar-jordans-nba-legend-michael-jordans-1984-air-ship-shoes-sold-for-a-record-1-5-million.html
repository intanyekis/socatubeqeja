One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.

It was 1985, and he was on an international tour playing a Nike exhibition game in Italy. Late in the game, Jordan gained possession of the ball and took off for a dunk. The force of his slam shattered the backboard, sending glass everywhere, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as recounted by SB nation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The shoes Jordan wore during that game <a href=#>sold in August 2020 for $615,000</a>, a record for a pair of sneakers at the time.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Billie Eilish Collaborates With Nike For Vegan Air Jordan Silhouettes</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SB Nation</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yio6Whn6N6pbvLpZirZZqkv6Wtzaxkp5qRYrmms8Snm2almZi1orHLZqGoqpSWu7R5kHJvbWWRnr9uv8eip2armKSytHnSqKOdZZakv26tjKucnKeimXpyeZRmpKKknJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
