Bruno Mars, whose real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, was born to a Filipina mother and a father who is half Puerto Rican and half Jewish.</p><p>During the interview, Charlamagne told the Grammy award-winning artist, "People love to accuse you of being a cultural thief, which I find interesting because you are a person of color. What would you say to those people?"</p><p>Mars responded to the host by acknowledging his influences, which were mainly prominent Black artists.</p><p>"I would say: You can't look at an interview, you can't find an interview where I'm not talking about the entertainers that come before me," Mars shared. "And the only reason why I'm here is because of James Brown, is because of Prince, Michael [Jackson] - that's the only reason why I'm here."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This music comes from love," he concluded, "and if you can't hear that, then I don't know what to tell you."</p><p>He went on to add that the criticism he is facing "comes with the gig," but that "there's real merit to what people are saying about Black entertainers not getting their flowers."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React To Bruno Mars And Anderson Paak Forming A New Band</a></span></p><p>This isn't the first time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruno Mars had to defend himself against cultural appropriation claims</a>&nbsp;- the accusations first began&nbsp;in 2018, when an activist by the name of Seren Sensei accused the star of being a "cultural appropriator," according to&nbsp;CNN.</p><p>However, several Black artists, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevie Wonder, have come to his defense</a>.
