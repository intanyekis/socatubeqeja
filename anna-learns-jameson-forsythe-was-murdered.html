Sonny drops by, and they sit down. He asks about being back at work, and Sasha says it’s been going well. She needs the company to do well as they lost so much money during the lawsuit. Sonny explains that’s why he came, he wants to talk about her financial situation. He’d like to audit her accounts to find out how much Gladys stole from her. She doesn’t see the point as the money is gone and so is Gladys. She thanks him for getting Gladys out of town and not sending her to prison, he was merciful to her. She is focused on moving forward and the future, but Sonny feels she still deserves to get her money back.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sonny-helps-sasha-gh-abc.jpg alt="Sonny wants to help Sasha GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sonny feels responsible for not keeping a closer eye on Gladys as Sasha’s guardian. He wants to pay Sasha back every dime she lost. Sasha appreciates the offer and is touched, but she can’t accept it. She doesn’t need the money back, and this has taught her that she’s stronger than anyone thought. She says for the first time in ages she’s enjoying herself, and the silver lining in all of this is she sees every day as a gift, and she knows she is a survivor. Sonny feels he still owes her, and he likes to pay his debts. She insists this isn’t his debt. She suggests he donate the money to a charity that supports mental health in Brando’s name and they’ll call it even. He tells her that she has a deal.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sonny-sasha-help-gh-abc.jpg alt="Sonny wants to payback Sasha GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Giving thanks for soaps this Thanksgiving</a></p><p>Gregory stops by to see Alexis at the office, and she sees he’s using a cane. Gregory says he’ll need it until he’ll need a wheelchair. She’s in favor of keeping him on his feet as long as possible. She asks what she can do for him, and he needs her to help Finn. He fills her in on the issues with Diane being unable to represent Finn, and Alexis calls this a disaster as Diane never loses. She says the hardest cases she’s faced have been against Diane. She says Finn comes off as not very personable, so Diane will use that to paint him as arrogant doctor. Alexis has an idea and makes a call.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alexis-gregory-finn-gh-abc.jpg alt="Gregory asks for Alexis' help GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Scholarship fund set up in Billy Miller’s name</a></p><p>Curtis visits with Nina at the Metro Court. She apologizes for not being in touch sooner but is so happy that he wanted to meet. He says she might not like what he needs to ask her, as it’s a big favor. He is looking into his shooting, and Nina asks where she comes in. He was hoping she could give him complete access to the hotel. Nina gives him a master keycard to the hotel and says the room the shooter was in has been kept vacant. He asks about security footage, and she says it was the first thing the cops took, but the original footage may still be accessible in the mainframe. Curtis asks if he can have her password to it, and she gives it to him. She trusts him, and she knows this is important to him. Curtis lets her know the bullet likely was intended for Anna or Sonny. Nina wants to make sure that this person doesn’t try to shoot her husband again, which makes this important to her too.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/curtis-nina-news-gh-abc.jpg alt="Curtis and Nina talk GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Nina talks about being married to Sonny, and growing closer to Willow and her grandchildren, and while she’s happy, she’s scared at what she has to lose. He tells her what his Aunt Stella told him in rehab, stop focusing on the negative and focus on what you have. Nina says she doesn’t want anyone to take her family away. Curtis can tell they aren’t talking about Sonny anymore. Nina says it’s nothing, just a little tension between her and Michael. He knows she’s not telling him everything, and he won’t push. However, if she ever needs help, he’s here for her. She thanks him.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nina-troubling-news-gh-abc.jpg alt="Nina helps Curtis GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Maura West honors Roger Howarth</a></p><p>In the mayor’s office, Martin and Laura chat about how Laura came through to help him with one of his real estate clients. Laura turns to topic to their brother. Martin suggests she use her powers to banish Cyrus from Port Charles. She isn’t sure she could do that or would want to do that. She’s suspicious of this born-again persona, but she wonders if they have some responsibility to try and support him in becoming a productive member of society. Martin can’t think of what he could contribute to Port Charles, but part of him does want to believe in this reformation.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/laura-martin-cyrus-gh-abc.jpg alt="MArtin and Laura talk Cyrus GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Laura and Martin are interrupted by Jordan, and Martin excuses himself. Laura explains they were discussing their brother Cyrus, and asks why Jordan came to see her. Jordan needs to look into something, but it must be off the record. She tells Laura about wanting to help Curtis find out who shot him, and Laura gives Jordan her blessing to pursue this with Curtis. Jordan says this is the first time since the shooting that she’s seen Curtis with a light in his eyes again. She needs to support Curtis in this, as it’s important for him to move forward.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jordan-asks-for-favor-bb-cbs.jpg alt="Jordan asks a favor GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Why Roger Howarth left General Hospital</a></p><p>Back at The Invader office, Martin arrives per Alexis’ request. She explains her friend and Gregory’s son Finn needs a lawyer, and as Valentin’s lawyer, this could be useful in helping a client like Finn. If Martin can make Valentin seem sympathetic, he can do the same for Finn. Gregory wants to give Finn an option to weigh in before putting Martin on retainer. Martin needs to know about the case first, so Gregory fills him in on Finn being sued for malpractice. Martin realizes the challenge he has ahead, especially when he questions whether Finn missed something important that led to this man’s death and Gregory goes off on him. He asks if Finn reacts in the same way when questioned, and Alexis tells him, “Oh much worse.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/martin-case-gh-abc.jpg alt="Martin takes Finn's case GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Martin explains to Gregory how malpractice suits often play out in court, and many times the jury feels more for the victim rather than about the actual facts of the case. The jury will see a grieving widow with young children, and if Finn insists on the stand that he did nothing wrong, he’ll lose. Gregory says he’ll lose if he admits he overlooked something. Martin says the best approach is to make the jury see Finn is an excellent doctor and finding him liable will do more harm than good and cost many lives down the road. Alexis says it’s the strategy that she’d use. Gregory thinks they’ve found a lawyer for Finn.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gregory-martin-gh-abc.jpg alt="Gregory is defensive GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the morgue, Dante and Chase talk to the coroner about the death of a pedestrian who appeared to be hit by a fast-moving vehicle. The coroner can see no reason why this man would step in front of a vehicle, as he was otherwise healthy and in no way impared. Dante suggests the vehicle may have been aiming for him.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dante-chase-meet-corenor-gh-abc.jpg alt="Chase Dante morgue GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Chase reveals to Dante that the guy had three IDs on him and they were all legit and from three different countries under the same name. Dante asks Chase to have his prints run through the system.</p><p>Chase leaves, and the coroner tells Dante the victim has a key he’d been hiding in his left shoe, and it had begun to create a callus on his heel. Chase returns and says the fingerprints match up with Jameson Forsythe.</p><p>At the hospital, Anna sneaks in to see Charlotte, who panics. Anna only wants to explain what happened. Charlotte cries she shot her, but Anna says it was an accident. Anna says she needs to know that nothing that Victor told her about her is true.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/charlotte-terrified-gh-abc.jpg alt="Charlotte afraid GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Out in the hall, Valentin shows up, and he and Liz hear Charlotte screaming for help. They run in to find Anna in the room with Charlotte. Liz sees Anna out, as Valentin comforts his daughter. Liz tells Anna she was told she was not allowed in Charlotte’s room, but Anna only wanted to convince her she didn’t want to hurt her. Liz says she just did, and going in there was the wrong move.</p><p>Valentin exits and asks Liz to go stay with Charlotte. She leaves, and Valentin asks what Anna thought she was doing. She explains she was undoing the damage he and his father did. She tells him that his actions caused this mess, and Charlotte needs to know that Victor lied to her. Valentin doesn’t know how many years of therapy Charlotte has to undergo to come to terms with this, but if she wants to help then just stay away. Anna thinks he’s blaming her, but he says he blames himself.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/valentin-furious-gh-abc.jpg alt="Valentin fumes GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Valentin walks away, and Dante calls Anna as there is something at the morgue she needs to see. Later Liz apologizes to Valentin and says she’ll make sure Charlotte’s victors are restricted. He goes in to see Charlotte, who cries that Anna wants to kill her. He assures Charlotte she’s in no danger from Anna, but she says he’s wrong.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dante-lead-gh-abc.jpg alt="Dante calls Anna GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Beloved Hallmark show canceled</a></p><p>Anna arrives at the morgue and is filled in by Dante that a man was run down at high speed. Anna asks what this has to do with her. Dante explains he may be a WSB agent given he had three legit IDs from three countries. He asks if she could possibly identify him. Anna looks at the body and knows who it is. She identifies him as Jameson Forsythe, and he was in the WSB. She hasn’t seen him in thirty years, and he’s the guy she had criminal evidence against that went missing the night Charlotte was shot. Anna assumes he broke into her apartment to destroy the files, but now the question is who killed him, and where is the evidence now?</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anna-dante-jameson-gh-abc.jpg alt="Anna is shocked GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On the next General Hospital: <a href=# rel=noopener>Thanksgiving begins in Port Charles. </a>Molly, TJ, Alexis, Jordan, Sam and Kristina toast.
