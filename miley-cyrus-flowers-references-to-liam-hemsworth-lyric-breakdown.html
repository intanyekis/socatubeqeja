I can take myself dancing and I can hold my own hand. Yeah, I can love me better than you can.”</p><p class=p1>The Tennessee native also <a href=#>released a music video</a> for “Flowers” on Friday, in which she strutted around a mansion by herself. In the footage, Cyrus danced alone, lounged in a pool, completed a solo workout and picked out an outfit.</p><p class=p1>The “Party in the USA” musician first met the Australia native <a href=#>on the set of 2010’s&nbsp;<i>The Last Song</i></a>, in which they played <a href=#>eventual couple Ronnie and Will</a>, respectively. After dating on and off following production, Hemsworth <a href=#>proposed in June 2012</a>. The duo called off their engagement in 2013 before <a href=#>eventually reuniting three years later</a>. They <a href=#>wed in December 2018</a> at their Tennessee home. They <a href=#>ultimately went their separate ways one year later</a> and their <a href=#>divorce was finalized in January 2020.</a><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“In trying to put that back together, instead of going, ‘Oh, nature kind of did something I couldn’t do for myself; it forced me to let go,’ I ran toward the fire,” the Disney Channel alum <a href=#>said of their on-off relationship during a December 2020 episode</a> of&nbsp;<i>The Howard Stern Show,&nbsp;</i>claiming there was “too much conflict” in their marriage. “Which is not abnormal, a lot of animals do this and end up dying, like, deers run into the forest.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “You’re attracted to that heat, and me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it, and not wanting to go, you know, ‘What could be purposeful about this?’ I just clung to what I had left of that house, which was me and him. And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>After their breakup, Cyrus was linked to <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a> and<a href=#> <strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a> before moving on with drummer <a href=#><strong>Maxx Morando</strong></a> last year.
