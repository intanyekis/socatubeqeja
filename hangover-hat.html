When a glass of water, a cold shower, and a cozy blanket—heck, even a cup of microwavable mac and cheese—all seemingly fail at making you feel any bit better. Yep, at that point, it’s time to call in the reinforcements. ICYMI, folks on social media have been buzzing about the latest (and hottest?) fashion trend: a hangover hat, which is basically a cross between a sleeping eye mask, and a 90s-style beanie that’s giving horror movie, ski masked-killer when worn.</p><p>Experts In This Article</p><p>That said, this accessory isn’t actually intended for wearing out in public. (But, hey, you do, you boo.) Instead, it’s meant to potentially help cure a hangover or raging headache when worn. But does it actually work? We caught up with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://drpatrickporter.com/>Patrick Porter, PhD</a>, a neuroscience expert and the founder and CEO of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://braintap.com/>BrainTap</a>, to see if a hangover hat is really the <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/walking-for-hangover/>answer to your hangover prayers</a>.</p><a title=@alixearle href=# rel="noopener nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@alixearle?refer=embed">@alixearle</a> Pulling up in my hangover hat ???

(To that point, TheraICE does have 28,000 nearly five-star Amazon reviews.)</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><a v-on:click.prevent="trackLinkGA($event, key)" :href=post.url data-url-source=related-content class=related-content__link referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url href=#></a><p>The headache relief cap, which can freeze in just two hours, offers <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/ice-cap-for-migraine/>therapeutic cooling benefits</a> that Dr. Porter says can help relieve the discomfort of a hangover (or a regular headache, for that matter). “The cooling aspect can constrict blood vessels, thereby reducing inflammation and pain. It also slows the conduction speed of pain signals in neurons, leading to diminished pain perception,” he says, similar to using a normal ice pack. The hardest part? Remembering to toss it in the fridge (or freezer) the night before.</p><p>“The cooling aspect can constrict blood vessels, thereby reducing inflammation and pain. It also slows the conduction speed of pain signals in neurons, leading to diminished pain perception."</p><p>What makes a hangover hat even better than simply slapping a bag of peas on your forehead is simple: The compression factor. “The hat's compression helps decrease swelling and inflammation, also aiding in pain reduction,” Dr. Porter says.</p><p>Although a hangover hat on its own can work wonders, the neuroscience expert suggests pairing it with a little brainwave entertainment. “On a neurological level, combining these physical effects with something like brainwave entrainment, used in the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://braintap.com/membership-and-headset/>BrainTap headset</a> [a brain fitness tool], can provide even more relief. Brainwave entrainment can help synchronize your brain's neural activities with a specific frequency, promoting relaxation and recovery,” Dr. Porter says.</p><h2><strong>How long do you need to wear a hangover hat to reap the benefits?</strong></h2><p>The good news is that you won’t necessarily need to wear a hangover hat out in public or for hours on end in order to reap the benefits. “The length of time you should wear the TheraICE cap generally depends on your personal comfort and the severity of the headache or hangover,” Dr. Porter says. But, generally speaking, 15 to 30 minutes should typically do the trick.</p><p>Something to note: The hat is designed to also cover your eyes, yet Dr. Porter says it isn’t all that necessary. The cooling and compression on your head on their own will typically suffice. But to further enhance your state of relaxation and speed up the hangover recovery, he recommends lying down while wearing the cap for optimal tranquility. But if you need to get up and walk around, it’s a-okay to keep it on. Just be warned: You may get some questionable stares from your neighbors or family pet.</p><p>If you need to get up and walk around, it’s a-okay to keep it on.

As such, he emphasizes that rehydrating after a long night out is the number one priority. “Dehydration is a frequent contributor to both hangovers and headaches, so ensuring <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/electrolytes-hangover/>proper hydration and electrolyte balance</a> is essential,” Dr. Porter says. And if all else fails, <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/tylenol-for-hangover/>over-the-counter (OTC) medications</a>—when taken appropriately—can also help provide some relief.</p><p>A quick and easy tension-relieving stretch:</p><p></p><p>Our editors independently select these products.
