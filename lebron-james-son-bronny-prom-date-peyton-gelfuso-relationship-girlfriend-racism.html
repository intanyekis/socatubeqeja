It's got people wondering who she is and what there is to know about her.</p><h2 id=who-is-lebron-james-son-bronny-james>Who Is LeBron James Son Bronny James?</h2><p>Bronny James is not one for sharing much of his personal life; instead, he is focused on being the best athlete he can be. And he is already proving to be incredibly talented. He has been playing Point Guard at Sierra Canyon School, and in 2023, he confirmed that he would be heading to the University of Southern California to continue to play basketball. His proud dad shared the news with reporters.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Being A Billionaire Allowed Lebron James To Make Some Truly Bizarre Investment Decisions</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[It's] one of the best days of my life," LeBron James said after the game against Golden State Warriors (via HollywoodLife). "First of all, congratulations on Bronny and the decision he made… super proud of him… our family is proud of him. For me, personally, it's even more special to me 'cause it's the first time someone out of my family to go to college."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-family.jpg><p>But before his college life starts, everyone has been focusing on Bronny's prom. In 2022, it was revealed that he had attended his prom with his rumored girlfriend, Peyton Gelfuso (<a href=#>fans continue to be confused about his relationship status</a>).</p><p><a href=#>Savannah James, who is Bronny's mom</a>, shared photos of their prom, and more were later posted to Mystique Blog, which showed them looking very smart.

This would be the second time they made headlines for attending a special high school event together. Savannah James shared photos of her son looking incredibly handsome and grown up, which she captioned with "Prom 2023. Lost for words on this one."</p><p>LeBron James was also proud of this moment and shared his own photos of his son on social media. In the caption, he wrote, "TOUGH. Chrome Hearts Big Steppa VIBEZ!!! #Prom2023 #HandsomeYoungMan @bronny. P.S. The best Prom outfit of ALL-TIME!!

According to New York Post, Bronny wore a "custom black Chrome Hearts suit with Dior shoes." He chose to skip the shirt. His date, Gelfuso, is reported to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have worn a black strapless dress</a> (although she did not appear in photos posted on either Savannah or LeBron's social media). But what should have been a beautiful moment was met with unfair criticism.</p><p>Fox News notes that a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo taken from the night received criticism</a>. The publication wrote: "The USC commit's photos were plastered across Instagram over the course of the week, and some appeared to be upset with James taking Gelfuso to the prom because she is White."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LeBron-James-Cant-Keep-A-Straight-Face-During-National-Anthem-Rendition.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Attending their second event together increased the attention on Bronny and Peyton's relationship. However, they have not confirmed nor denied whether they are dating.</p><p>According to New York Post, Peyton Gelfuso and attends Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Texas. She is also much more active on social media than Bronny and currently has tens of thousands of followers on Instagram. But, if we needed a clue as to what was happening with them, Bronny did comment on Peyton's photos. This includes comments like "why u so cute doe," "perf fr;" and "thas cute." Is this definitive proof that they are more than friends? Absolutely not, but it offers a glimpse into their platonic or romantic relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How LeBron James' Wife Has Supported His Career</a></span></p><p>If you are curious about who Peyton Gelfuso is (apart from being stunning and sharing a glimpse into her glamorous world and great style), you may have to wait until she or Bronny James decides to share an update.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/peyton.jpg><p>For now, we can focus on the basketball player's exciting future ahead of him.

"I need to be on the floor with my boy, I got to be on the floor with Bronny," he said (via ESPN). "Either in the same uniform or a matchup against him... But I would love to do the whole Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. thing. That would be ideal, for sure. I ask him what are his aspirations, and he says he wants to play in the NBA. So, if he wants do to it, he's got to put in the work. I'm here already, so I'm just waiting on him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnpqipLtutsCmnKxlo6S7bq7RqKWnsV2lv7C5jJ2YrZ1dpbK6wM6nZKCdnJvCtLuMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lopawqr%2FMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
