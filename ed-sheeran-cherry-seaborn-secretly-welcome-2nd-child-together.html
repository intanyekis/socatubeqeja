Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here. We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I’ll see you when it’s time to come back, Ed.”</p><p class=p1>The England native and Seaborn have kept their little one private amid his successful career. However, Lyra is <a href=#>often the first to hear her dad’s new music</a> ahead of its release.</p><p class=p1>“I’ll sing [my new songs] to my daughter, who’s not my biggest fan. She just cries,” Sheeran said <a href=#>during an appearance on Radio 1’s Big Weekend in May 2021</a>. “No, I’ve got some she likes. She really likes ‘Shape of You.’ The marimba sound is good, but she doesn’t like anything loud or anything belt-y.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i><a href=#>previously confirmed in July 2020 that Sheeran and the businesswoman were expecting</a> their first child.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I just found that I really didn’t have a purpose outside of [music] because when I was giving myself fixed time of no work, I wasn’t doing anything I enjoyed because I love doing music,” the music artist noted during a December 2021 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i></a>&nbsp;of new fatherhood. “And [being a dad] has actually given me purpose and something in life that’s actually more important than my job.”</p><p class=p1>He further gushed about her milestones at the time, noting that Lyra was <a href=#>walking and talking</a> “constantly with a piece of bread” in her hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaenF2otaax0ZqlZpuYmr%2BzxYysnJqan6e7br%2FEnKmerJyuerixy5ympp1dZ7ulecKhoKWcXam8qLHToZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
