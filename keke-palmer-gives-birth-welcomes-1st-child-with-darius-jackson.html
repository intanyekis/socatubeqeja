People kept coming up to me [and saying,] ‘Congratulations.’ I’m like, ‘Sssh, can y’all stop? I got a liquor sponsorship on the line. Let the check clear and then we can get to the damn baby shower!’”</p><p>Palmer and Jackson first began dating in summer 2021, shortly after Jackson’s brother, <strong>Sarunas Jackson</strong>, starred in Insecure with Palmer.</p><p>The pair have been notoriously private with their relationship ever since but have <a href=#>shared glimpses</a> via social media.</p><p>“You’ve been a blessing from above,” Darius wrote in a since-deleted post via Instagram when the couple confirmed their relationship in August 2021. “Never would have expected summer 2021 to turn out the way it did, but here we are. I’m glad we were able to help each other throughout our <a href=#>lowest of times</a> & show one another that what we are bringing to the table is everything that we got.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Keke-Palmers-Baby-Bump-Album-Ahead-of-First-Childs-Arrival-With-Boyfriend-Darius-Jackson-03.jpg><p>The Hustlers actress, who has previously been open about her fears of <a href=#>dating people in the industry</a>, opened up about her beau during the Tamron Hall Show. “I’ve always been somebody that hasn’t wanted too much industry stuff in my life,” she said in November 2021. “[Darius is] very industry-adjacent, meaning he understands it but that’s not what he’s about. We spend all this time together, and he really is my closest friend.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shortly after sharing her pregnancy news, Palmer gushed over the fitness instructor. “Thank you to my other half @dvulton for giving me the things that only true unity can bring,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on December 5. “Love is all we have isn’t it, you do nothing in this world alone and trust me, I am not alone!”</p><p>Before Jackson, Palmer was linked to musician <strong>Styn</strong>, <strong>Rodney King</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Quincy Brown</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>YG</strong>.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknZuaerGty6acq2WXnsOmv4yboKusmGLEprjCqKSeq11mwLV5wqGgpZxdrLa1tIydmKuhpah6q63CpKqopl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
