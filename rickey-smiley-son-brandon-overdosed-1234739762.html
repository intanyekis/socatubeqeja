After one month,<a href=# data-type=post data-id=627731> the longtime comedian</a> has revealed that the 32-year-old, may have “succumbed to drug abuse.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Smiley, 54, told host Melvin Craig that it was his son’s girlfriend who called him to unfortunately share the news that Brandon was “unresponsive” and “in her words, that he had OD’d.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He used, and it killed him,” Smiley added before sharing that he was “shocked but not surprised” by his son’s death.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As a toxicology report has not been revealed as of publication, the 54-year-old said that he had “prepared, deep inside” for a possible fatality due to Brandon’s <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234618606>battle with drug addiction.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-528413642.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“His mother and I made several attempts to try to send him to get the help that he needed — send him to rehab,” Smiley continued. “We thought that he was doing better. He had just joined the church and he had just gotten baptized again — probably a month before he passed away.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Without answers to what triggered Brandon’s drug abuse, Smiley shared that his family is “all clean and sober.” He added, “We just assume that if you’re in a good school district or you’re in a gated community or everything is going good that these kids are not doing drugs. You don’t have to be in the hood.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, during the time that he <a href=# rel=nofollow>revealed his son’s death to social media</a>, Smiley recalled, “My granddaddy went through this sh*t with my dad, and somehow, here I am going through the same thing my grandparents went through.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the time he requested prayers for his son’s mother, Brenda Morris, as well as Brandon’s daughter, Storm.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at Rickey Smiley courageously speak on his son Brandon Smiley’s death below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e2pLfEsmSspZmhsrp50qilZpqilrulu81mpq%2Bdopm8tLHDZmhra2RsgHqDlWtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
