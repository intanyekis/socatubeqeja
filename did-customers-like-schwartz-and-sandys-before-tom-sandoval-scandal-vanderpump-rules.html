From the very first episode, it was clear that working at Lisa Vanderpump's SUR meant dealing with big personalities.

There is a pop-up on the restaurant's Yelp page that reads "Unusual Activity Alert" and says that no new comments can be posted. The notice says, "This business recently received increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news. "</p><p>The reviews posted before the scandal were mostly positive.

The customer wrote, "Fun, friendly vibe with none of the pretentiousness you'd expect from a "celeb-run" establishment."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Ariana Madix Made $1 Million From The Vanderpump Rules Cheating Scandal</a></span></p><p>Another review said that the burger is delicious and that Tom Schwartz chatted with customers. The reviewer wrote, "He is one of the kindest and most humble people."</p><p>It seems like many Vanderpump Rules would visit Schwartz and Sandy's and hope to catch a glimpse of Schwartz and Sandoval. After all, it's cool to eat and drink at a place owned by favorite reality stars. But now that the Vanderpump Rules scandal has been making waves for months now, people aren't sure how to feel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But while there were many happy customers who enjoyed dining at Schwartz and Sandy's, some felt that the atmosphere wasn't great. There are many Yelp reviews calling it "dead" and saying that there were no other people at the bar. One review said the bartender was "slow and unfriendly" and the espresso cocktail wasn't great. They wrote, "Save your $$ and stick to Pump to feel the Vanderpump Rules vibes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tom-sandoval.jpg><p>Some former customers felt that the restaurant seems more exciting and beautiful on TV than in real life. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Customers discussed Schwartz and Sandy's</a> in a Reddit thread called "Something about Schwartz & Sandy's seems really off."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Redditor wrote, "There’s definitely some Hollywood magic going into the restaurant’s look on the show. On google street view it’s in a little strip mall with a dog groomer, a dry cleaner, and a pizza delivery."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was The Whole 'Scandoval' Drama Faked For Vanderpump Rules Ratings?</a></span></p><p>Another Redditor said it "felt unfinished" and "the vibe is off." They noted that while it was 10 p.m. on a Friday evening, the kitchen was closed, and the menu didn't have enough food items on it.</p><p>Another general complaint that customers have? The Schwartz and Sandy's website looks the same way that it always has. It's true that it doesn't include a menu, and that would definitely be a nice touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tom-schwartz-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Schwartz and Sandy's is still operating, it's possible that things will get trickier if Sandoval and Schwartz continue to not talk to each other.</p><p>After the scandal broke, Sandoval posted a message on Instagram. He said, “Schwartz specifically only found out about this very recently, and most definitely did not condone my actions. This was a very personal thing."</p><p>Sandoval continued, "there are 3 other partners and 20 employees, who especially rely on the restaurant for income for them and their families. Just like TomTom, I'm a small part of a much bigger thing. Please direct ur anger toward me and not them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmMK0wM6mnKurXaG2rLGMrJqhr5Gnwbt5wKebZquRo7G6v4ybnJ%2Bnopp6tbvMZqqappSkw6K4jKyamqaUlrluwsCnm56qoKq6sXnRrqOeq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
