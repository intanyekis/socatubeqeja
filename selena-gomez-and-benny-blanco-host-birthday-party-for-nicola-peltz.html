The crew — including Gomez’s little sister, Gracie — rocked matching navy Eberjay pajamas, ate birthday cake and played party games.</p><p class=p1>Gomez and Blanco’s debut hosting event <a href=#>marks another milestone</a> in their romance.

The end. … He’s still better than anyone I’ve been with. Facts.”</p><p class=p1>Days later, Gomez hard-launched their relationship on her Instagram feed as she shared pics of the pair packing on the PDA. In the snaps, Gomez also prominently wore a “B” diamond ring that seemingly corresponded to Blanco’s initials. (His real name is Benjamin Levin.)</p><p class=p1>“Selena hasn’t felt this happy about anybody she’s dated in a really long time,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told<i> Us Weekly</i></a> later that month, noting her family approves of the pairing. “Selena and Benny are truly in love and although she has kept most people she’s dated under wraps, with Benny, she couldn’t wait to reveal they were together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Gomez’s romance with Blanco, a music producer who she previously worked with on several of her hit songs, <a href=#>has continued to flourish</a> in the new year.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>“Selena has made it clear that she wants Benny by her side from now on, and she’s proudly introducing him to everyone in her life,” a second source revealed<i> </i><a href=#>in the latest issue</a> of <i>Us Weekly. </i>“They kept things low-key [at first], but Benny has passed every test with flying colors. The new year seemed like a perfect time to essentially shout [their love] from the rooftops, so that’s what Selena is doing.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZyau6J5xqiknrJdlrulecGepaexXZe5orrCqGShp6OpeqO10a2fnZmpYr2ivtOyZJ%2BnomK7qq%2FOpZhmqJWhwbt7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
