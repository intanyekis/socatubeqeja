Users are left wondering as the social media giant threatens to remove their synced photos if they don’t install the Moments app before a looming deadline.</p><p>Facebook has recently issued a warning to its users regarding the deletion of their synced photos.</p><p>It will occur if they fail to install the Moments app before the 7th of July.&nbsp;</p><p>The social media giant has been notifying users about the upcoming deletion.</p><p>It has been urging them to download and log into Moments to retain their privately synced photos.</p><p>Back in 2012, Facebook unveiled its photo syncing feature, enabling users to effortlessly upload photos from their smartphones to a personal album.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like Google Photos, Yahoo’s Flickr, and Apple’s iCloud Photos, countless users embraced this functionality as a means of securely storing their cherished memories.</p><p>Regrettably, <a href=#>Facebook</a> made the decision to halt the automatic syncing of photos from its primary app earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, Facebook left the users with no choice but to install the Moments app.</p><p>Installation of the app is necessary if the users desire to persist with the hassle-free photo uploading procedure.</p><p>Facebook has taken a step further by threatening to delete all the synced photos if users do not comply with installing Moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>All you need to know about the fact that ‘is Facebook deleting photos’</h2><p>In its notification, Facebook explained the situation to users: <strong>“Photos you privately synced from your phone to Facebook will be deleted soon. Earlier this year, they were moved to Moments, a new app from Facebook. If you want to keep these photos, download and log into Moments before 7 July. If you don’t want Moments, download these photos directly to your computer from your Facebook profile before 7 July.”</strong></p><p>It’s worth noting that the removal of synced photos will not impact any photos or videos shared separately on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has given its clients the chance to download their synchronized photographs before the cancellation happens.</p><p>Facebook’s latest move should come as no surprise, considering the company’s previous tactics with its Messenger app.</p><p>By separating the chat feature from the main Facebook app and compelling users to install Messenger, Facebook successfully amassed over 900 million users on the standalone platform.</p><p>Facebook’s decision to discontinue photo syncing on its main app and the subsequent threat of deleting synced photos is a strategic push towards the adoption of Moments.</p><p>The app has quickly gained momentum, soaring to the top of the charts for free Android and iOS apps.</p><p>It has captured a prominent position in the UK and steadily growing in popularity across the US.</p><p>Despite these significant developments, Facebook has chosen not to provide an official comment on the matter.</p><p>The new decision has left users to speculate about the motivations behind these decisions.</p><p>Users who wish to retain their synced photos should take proactive measures before the specified deadline.</p><p>By doing so, they can ensure the preservation of their valuable photo collections and avoid any potential loss.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC10madmpuVl7ywt4ydnKWdpJ67qHnPoaatp6NisLC606umr52iqLaiuIytn6udkal6s7HMqK2eZZmirqix0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
