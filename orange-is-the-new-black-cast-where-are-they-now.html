Based on <a href=#><strong>Piper Kerman’</strong>s 2010 memoir</a>, Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison, the series follows PR exec Piper Chapman (Schilling) as she adjusts to life in a minimum-security women’s prison in Connecticut. While doing time, Piper reconnects with her old flame Alex Vause (Prepon), whose drug trafficking past put Piper behind bars.</p><p>With seven seasons between 2013 and 2019, the <strong>Jenji Kohan</strong>-created show is one of Netflix’s longest-running original series to date. Over the years, Orange Is the New Black earned <a href=#>21 Emmy nominations</a> and four wins, including Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series. The ensemble — which includes <a href=#><strong>Uzo Aduba</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Laverne Cox</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Natasha Lyonne</strong></a> — earned three SAG Awards as a group from 2015 to 2017.</p><p>Orange Is the New Black left behind a big legacy after portraying female characters with depth and giving room for <a href=#>LGBTQ romances</a> to grow onscreen. Before season 7 aired in 2019, Schilling told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> her biggest hope was that “people feel seen, and that there’s a reflection in the series of what has been happening to the cultural collective.”</p><p>Cox, for her part, was grateful for the <a href=#>authentic representation</a> of life as a trans woman. Her character, Sophia Burset, ends the series by being released from prison and following her dreams of becoming a hairstylist.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought, ‘What can it mean for audiences to see this and for a Black trans woman who’s formerly incarcerated to get out of prison and win?’ We need to see that,” Cox recalled in an August 2020 interview with <a href=#>TV Insider</a>. “The trans people in real life need to see it. Non-trans people in real life need to see that. I always think about the first time we saw a Black president was on television, [in] 24 and probably other shows, before it happened in real life. I think sometimes, if we can see it on screen, then we can begin to imagine it. That’s what <a href=#>Sophia’s evolution</a> and her ending on Orange Is the New Black means for me.”</p><p>Scroll down to find out what the stars of Orange Is the New Black are doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bkv6K6xp5koqtdqbWmec2ermaanJawrHnCmqqtZaedsrOxjJqpnmWknbK6ec2ormg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
