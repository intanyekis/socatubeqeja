He gained the attention of Lalit Mohan and he rapidly promoted through the ranks. He is known for turnarounds and his first was with the Andhra Pradesh Rayons (APR). He also did the same for the new export oriented business in BILT which included leather, shoes and foods.</p><p>In 1999, the family’s assets were divided into four. Gautam’s older brother parted ways in 2005. On July 22, 2004, he became the Chairman of Crompton Grooves. He was named the Chairman of Avanta Group on July 1, 2006.

The main businesses of Avanta group have struggled. His shares at the flagship Crompton Greaves, the maker of power equipment, also fell by 16% due to the rising costs, Chinese competition, and weak European markets. Its paper firm Ballarpur Industries saw margins fall due to supply glut. The Group is reported mulling an insurance venture with Ergo, the arm of Munich Re.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm6mirKlir7a%2FyKecrKtfmLKwe8aarK2ZnWLBqa3PmqlmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
