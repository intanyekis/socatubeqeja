Even Kimberly&nbsp;couldn’t help but swoon over how successfully her relationship is progressing, which began earlier this summer. While fund-raising in the Hamptons last week for Republican Rep. <strong>Lee Zeldin</strong>, Kimberly revealed how she really feels about her and President <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> son as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a couple</a>.&nbsp;“I’ve never been happier,” Guilfoyle told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>&nbsp;on Aug. 24 at the Sandcastle estate in Bridgehampton, New York. “I am thrilled to be joining Don Jr. across the country in amplifying the America-first message. We are working non-stop and we make the perfect team.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The former Fox News host shared similar sentiments later in front of the Sandcastle crowd, the publication reported. “It was an honor to travel across the country and see how America was becoming great again,” Kimberly had said to introduce Don Jr., who then said, “She’s a tough act to follow.” Kimberly isn’t the only one who thinks her and Don Jr. make the “perfect team.” The publication reported that a guest remarked Kimberly and Don Jr.&nbsp;“arrived like royalty and worked the room together. They are a real power couple.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Touring the country together as political powers may be the closest Kimberly and Don Jr. will get to a “honeymoon” in the meantime. Don Jr. is still finalizing his&nbsp;divorce with <strong>Vanessa Trump</strong>, 40, whom were last seen in court on July 26. But it should go smoothly. Vanessa even gave the new couple her blessing on June 14, tweeting, “The lengths people will go to attack a woman simply because she’s dating Don. We’ve been separated for over 9 months and respect each other’s decisions & privacy. We’ll focus on raising our great kids. Would be nice if the press did the same rather than obsess over our pvt lives!” As of now, Don Jr. hasn’t replaced Kimberly’s cocktail ring with an engagement ring just yet. “Don and Kimberly are not engaged,” our source confirmed EXCLUSIVELY with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, following the rumors Kimberly’s giant diamond ring started from a July 25 Instagram post.&nbsp;“Kimberly was simply wearing a cocktail ring, and it was actually on her middle finger.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>HollywoodLife has reached out to Kimberly Guilfoyle’s rep for a comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH15e5FwZqShnZeys7jYZp6uoZybvLq4xGabqKaRobFuwNGupKllmqd6s7HLmquip56otaq8jKmcq56VmMFuwMSapGahnqmys8LInq5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
