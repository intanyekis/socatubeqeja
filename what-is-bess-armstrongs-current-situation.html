John is also a producer and actor in the entertainment sector.</p><p>The loving couple has two boys, Samuel Chase Fiedler and Luke Allen Fiedler, and they live a lovely family life. Before having two children, the couple experienced an awful occurrence with their first child, Lucy Chase Fiedler.</p><p>Bess and her husband were expecting a kid at the time of their wedding.
