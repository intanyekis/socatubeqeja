The exes were smiling and looked cozy — with Katina resting her leg atop her husband’s — while relaxing at Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya Resort.</p><p>The Boston resident, meanwhile, shared more photos from their trip — including snaps of them on a boat and cuddling on an airplane — with a caption gushing over his wife.</p><p>“Never forget your [sic] a fearless women!” he wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Saturday, December 10. “Thank you for always having faith in whatever my heart and mind desires in life. Thank you for making sure I have a strong relationship with god. I appreciate everything you have taught me about myself without you even knowing it.”</p><p>He went on to rave about Married at First Sight: “I also want to thank MAFS that I met @__slimmgoodie no matter what life brings to us! God is good in so many ways I get emotional just thinking of my life and how much I have matured as a man. I am truly thankful words can’t express it🙏❤️!”</p><p>Goode and Dickerson met during Married at First Sight <a href=#>season 14</a> when <a href=#>they said “I do”</a> after meeting at the altar in July 2021. However, the lovebirds called it quits last month.</p><p>“After one year of marriage and careful thought and consideration, we have decided to part ways,” the spouses <a href=#>captioned a joint Instagram statement</a> on November 11. “However, this was not an easy decision to make.”</p><p>They continued: “We leave our marriage with enormous love and respect for each other. We only ask that, at this time, our privacy is respected.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though they were matched by the series’ relationship experts and chose to remain married on the Lifetime reality show, they struggled when Dickerson wanted Goode to fulfill his vision of an ideal wife who cooks and cleans. “I think she thinks of ‘I,’” he said <a href=#>in a March episode of MAFS</a>. “I talk to her about laziness.”</p><p>Goode admitted at the time that she struggled with how he constantly criticized her. “It’s just his tone,” she said at the time. “Like, I feel like someone’s beating up on me. Some of the things that he’s saying, they’re already insecurities that I’ve felt before this process. … It just makes me feel like I’m not good enough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammZaoeqyt06KlmmWRo7Fuu8uaoa6vn6N6ta3KnmSrp52Wu7W1wmarq6GgYq6nwMSrZKyonJ7BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
