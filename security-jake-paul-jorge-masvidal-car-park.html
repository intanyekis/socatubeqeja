You called me a punk b****.”</p><p>Masvidal responded, “I did," before the video ended abruptly.</p><p>It's not clear whether the encounter was staged, but Paul first called out his rival in 2021 after beating Tyron Woodley but the negotiating power for both has since diminished with retirement and defeat</p><p>Previously Gamebred had considered a fight with Paul but the latter's loss to Tommy Fury in February curtailed those thoughts.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><p>Even as recently as March it appeared Masvidal had little interest in fighting Paul, despite ending his UFC career.</p><p>“Right now there’s nobody that I could really think of to call out,” <a href=# aria-label="Masvidal told MMA Junkie Radio in March (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Masvidal told MMA Junkie Radio in March</a>. “But they already burst that bubble just because I always thought it would be a great fight for me, and that I could knock him out and make a lot of easy money while doing it, would have been Jake Paul. But that ship has sailed now that he lost that 0. Maybe he comes back and gets a couple of wins and stuff, but that’s probably the only dude because he’s easy money.</p><p>“I don’t think I was going to generate a huge pay-per-view sell with him, because he doesn’t bring those types of pay-per-views. But me being involved in boxing, who knows? Maybe I could have done well for myself and gotten some good pay-per-views.”</p><p>But as the pair clash in Miami a bout might be back in their thoughts.</p><p>That's despite Paul being set to box <a href=#>Nate Diaz in August</a>, while <a href=#>a rematch with Fury</a> is also on the cards.</p><p>"It's gonna happen.
