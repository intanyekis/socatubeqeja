Speaking to <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, Amy expressed excitement over helping Pete with his move.</p><p>"We are elated to be a part of the network of professionals Pete surrounds himself with," she shared. "Pete's property is well appointed with a modern interior, luxurious amenities and spectacular views."</p><p>Before moving into the Statent Island condo, Pete revealed he was still living with his mother after they bought a $1.3 million home on the island together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>So, I live with my mom</a>… well we bought a house together, but nobody believes that. So, I live with my mom, kinda,” Pete said during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>He continued, “So I have, like, a basement that’s mine, but that’s, like, an apartment, so I live underneath her.”</p><p>It was first reported in April 2021 that Pete bought himself the bachelor pad, which Kim Kardashian was spotted visiting during their brief relationship that started later in the year.</p><p>There’s no word on where in Brooklyn Pete is hoping to relocate to, or if he’s already found a place. But there’s speculation that his new girlfriend Emily Ratajkowski may influence where he ends up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports say the pair have been dating for a few months, though news of their romance only broke in November. Emily just finalized a divorce from her husband of four years, Sebastian Bear-McClard, after rumors of infidelity. Pete and Sebastian were actually friends before he began dating Emily.</p><p>Emily has her own apartment in New York’s downtown along with her 1-year-old son. While there’s no evidence to suggest Pete is moving specifically to be close to her, he may keep Emily’s location in mind when touring apartments.</p><p>Pete’s condo remains still on the apartment and a million-dollar price tag isn’t bad considering New York’s typical prices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Sandra Bullock Sold Her 91-Acre Avocado Farm For $5.6 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Fancy Pants Homes</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYsGwecyorZ5lpKR6o77OqKKlsZ5iuaq%2F06xkamVjYrqquMuipqdlo6mutbHNZqCspJGjsW6vzqebqGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
