I finally found my chauffeur for life and the one who makes my heart smile every single day. I can’t wait to do it all with you Tommy, thanks for making me the happiest gal alive. I love you to the moon & back ♥️.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BiPs-Becca-Kufrin-Shares-Husband-Thomas-Jacobs-Ideal-Wedding-Ring-Inline.jpg><p>Nearly five months later, Jacobs <a href=#>proposed</a> to Kufrin in October 2022 when he carved “Marry Me” into a pumpkin before getting down on one knee.</p><p>“Oui, si, ja, ken, da, ye, yas yes YES! Love you forever, my little pumpkin 🎃💍,” the couple wrote at the time via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in a joint post. “Now let’s get married!”</p><p>Kufrin, who held the <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> season 14 title, headed down to the beaches of Bachelor in Paradise in 2021 where she met Jacobs. Despite coupling up during season 7 of the reality show, Kufrin broke things off with Jacobs ahead of the season finale. But by August 2021, <a href=#>the pair reconciled</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We came back [home] and had to explore that on our own away from the cameras but in that moment [on the beach during the finale], I think that was game-changing for me,” Kufrin explained during an episode of the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast at the time. “Because I have really never had somebody fight, I would say, like, tooth and nail to want to keep a relationship with me.”</p><p>She continued: “We chatted until, like, 3 or 4 in the morning some nights and just talked about any and everything. The second I saw him — because I flew back to L.A. and then drove down to San Diego — I think right away he picked me up and kissed me and then we just had unlimited time to explore what this could be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboaCoeqOxwpyYZqOlm7%2BquoyopWagpaivorrDZquhp52WwG62wJymm6tdnrGmrctmqaKml2KvsMHJnpxmmZZk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
