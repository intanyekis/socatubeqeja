Alessandro has brought his innovative fashion sense and passion for diversity and inclusivity to the fashion house, leaving many confused as to how he could be cool with seeing the women who stand with Trump in his clothes — especially since the current administration’s policies are anything but diverse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kellyanne actually purchased the $3,600 coat from the Gucci Resort 2017 collection off-the-rack — and Alessandro stayed true to his inclusive nature when asked about her Inauguration Day outfit. “We have all kinds of customers,” he told The Washington Post. “Everybody is free to do what they want.” He also weighed in on his diplomatic approach to working with Melania. “To be against something or someone, it’s a dangerous thing,” he said. “It’s easy to be against your enemy, but if you give them a big hug ... . ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite the views of the current administration, Alessandro is focused on continuing to elevate the fashion house. “The more you are different, the more interesting. The more you are not like me, the more I want to get to know more about you,” he said. “I’m very curious. I feel more comfortable surrounded by people not like me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ever since he joined Gucci, Alessandro breathed new life into the label — and he continues to spread his inspiring message, both on and off the runway. “We have to use our voice. I don’t want to just talk about dress,” he said. “The way you think is important.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH12e5BwZqCtk5i2bq3LnqqsmZ6Zv7B5zKKaoZ2cmnquscuapaKZXam%2FtrnPZpurnaOotq%2BzjKKlrZ2iq7amw44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
