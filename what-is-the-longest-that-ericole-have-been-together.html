It seems that they have been apart longer than together since they have been on the show. I’m not trying to upset Ericole fans because I was a fan of them, especially JA portrayed Eric but they just don’t work anymore IMO. Seriously, what is so special about them? Does the term Supercouple really apply to them? My answer is no.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>delyla</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 30, 2023, 4:04am <span itemprop=position>2</span></span><p>5 minutes at best. She’s much more interesting with EJ, and only Sloan has ever made boring Eric tolerable.<br>I’ve never understood why TPTB try to force Ericole down our throats?

Let these new pairings develop, for goodness sakes!</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>The way I see it, Nicole is more into bed hopping that any long term relationship. She doesn’t hesitate to go from one bed to another in a nanosecond. Why bother putting her with anyone when you know it won’t last. She could probably make more money and be more qualified as a high paid prostitute than what she’s doing now.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Rose77</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 30, 2023, 3:30pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>They were together after Nicole came back from the dead and stayed together for a year during tje time jump. They broke off for a short while when Eric found out that Nicole lied to him about Mackenzie being his daughter. But got back together and finally got married. Eric left Nicole for his volunteer work in Africa 2 minutes after their wedding. So they were together roughly, and mostly off-screen, for 2 years (or maybe a year and a half).</p><p>Loved her with JA’s Eric… The only thing current Eric & JA’s Eric have in common is the name Eric Brady. Look, sound, behave; nothing alike.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Not long at all. It just makes no sense why TPTB want to put them back together. When they are together, it just never works. They may love each other but like Tina Turner said, “What’s love got to do with it?”</p><p>Eric comes alive when he is with Sloan. And Nicole (I hate to say it because I’m an Ejami fan) works best w/EJ. Leave these couples alone. If it’s not broke then don’t fix it!</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvWoZitZZmoerW0xGajqKaXmsC1edOhmK1llae2pLvLnmShmaaaeqOxxKdkraeXmsGpsdFob2lwY2mA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
