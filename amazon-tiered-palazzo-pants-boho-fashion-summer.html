Tiered dresses and tiered skirts simply have the ability to instantly draw Us in, capturing our hearts with their charm — and flowy fits! We own a couple of tiered tops as well. Just as comfy, just as cute. So what if we add <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">even more tiers</a> to our lives?</p><p>How about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tiered pants</a>? Yes, they exist, and yes, they’re just as amazing as you want them to be. They’re a boho dream come to life, making a stylish summer possible without having to sweat it out day after day. Oh, and they’re affordable — and available on Amazon!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Timemory Wife Leg Palazzo Pants</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26</a> at Amazon!

The subtle tier details take a cue from our beloved tiered dresses and skirts, adding even more drape and brilliance to an already-cute pair of palazzo pants. They also have a high-rise, wide waistband with stretch, plus a tie detail to really pull things together!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">These pants</a> even come in over 25 colors and patterns. Opt for a solid green, neutral beige or navy blue, perhaps, or go for a fun floral. You could also choose a pair with a cloud print or maybe a plaid! There are so many options, we think we might have to get two — minimum!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Timemory Wife Leg Palazzo Pants</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26</a> at Amazon!

They’re so easy to style too, since they’re so statement-making all on their own. All you really need is a simple top — a cropped tee, a tucked-in ribbed tank, a bandeau bra top, etc. You can simply wear sneakers or sandals on your feet too. You can dress them up as well though!</p><p>Try <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> with an off-the-shoulder bodysuit and heels, or a silky cami and pointy mules.
