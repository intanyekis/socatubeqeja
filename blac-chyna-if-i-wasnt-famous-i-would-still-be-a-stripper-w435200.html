Oh God, Rob. I don’t know. I would probably be working in the strip club. I’m just kidding.”</p><p>After pausing for a moment to think about her answer, the Lashed Bar entrepreneur admitted that her talents don’t extend far beyond strutting her stuff on stage. “I would probably be still in the strip club. I’m just keeping it real,” she added. “I can’t do nothing else.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Not that she has to worry about hopping back on the pole. The Washington, D.C., native’s rise to fame kicked off in 2010 after </span><b>Drake</b><span> name-dropped her in his hit single “Miss Me.” The shout-out ignited major buzz among the hip-hop community, and in November 2010 Chyna (real name: Angela Renee White) was asked to play </span><b>Nicki Minaj</b><span>’s stunt double in </span><b>Kanye West</b><span>’s “Monster” music video.</span></p><p>In 2011, she was cast as the leading lady in <b>Tyga</b>’s “Rack City” video. The pair struck up a romance and welcomed a son, King Cairo, in October 2012. Though the duo were once engaged, the rapper dumped Chyna in 2014 to date <b>Kylie Jenner</b>, Kardashian’s younger half-sister. Before her man left her for Jenner, 19, the makeup artist was good friends with <b>Kim Kardashian</b>.</p><p>The tables turned in January 2016, when the Arthur George sock designer, 29, and the video vixen went public with their relationship, a revelation that sparked a media firestorm. And in May, the unlikely couple announced that they would be <a href=#>welcoming a baby</a> later this year. Naturally, their road to parenthood will be covered on Chyna and Kardashian’s forthcoming docuseries.</p><p>However, if all the notoriety were to disappear one day, the sole male Kardashian said that he would gladly follow his love back to the strip club. “That’s all right. And I would probably be in the strip club also. I would definitely go and find Chyna and go to the strip club. Eat some food,” he shared. “They got the best food in the strip club.”</p><p><i>Rob & Chyna</i> premieres on E!
