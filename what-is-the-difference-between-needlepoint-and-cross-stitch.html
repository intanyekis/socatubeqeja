It is mostly done with yarn, but a different look may be achieved by using strands of embroidery floss. It is however stitched by hand, as opposed to being woven on a loom. This method also allows for the use of a variety of stitches over the base canvas layer.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It is widely used to decorate accessories such as belts, purses, jewelry and also wall hangings.
