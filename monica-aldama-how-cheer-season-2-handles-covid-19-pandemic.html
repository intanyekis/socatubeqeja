She reflected on the show’s popularity and why a second season once seemed like a long shot.</p><p>“I knew that was a&nbsp;possibility,&nbsp;but I also thought when it came out that they might not do another season just because it was so good. How do you top it?” she told Us.&nbsp;“Everything happened so&nbsp;fast,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I think they were caught off guard too.&nbsp;We were all just scrambling because it just blew up so fast. It&nbsp;was just kind of a whirlwind.”</p><p>Since attaining fame from Cheer, <a href=#>Aldama has written a book</a> titled Full Out: Lessons in Life and Leadership From America’s Favorite Coach. She confessed to Us that she was “nervous” about releasing the project because “everybody’s a critic.”</p><p>“After&nbsp;Cheer came out, I realized that there’s a whole world of critics that I’m not used to.&nbsp;I’m used to always doing everything right,” she explained.&nbsp;“I’ve gotten used to it, but obviously it’s&nbsp;something I’ve never done before, so I’m a little bit nervous, but&nbsp;I’m excited to have it&nbsp;come&nbsp;out.”</p><p>Despite her apprehension, Aldama hopes to inspire others with the wisdom she has picked up over the years. “I think what makes you successful in life is being able to,&nbsp;No. 1,&nbsp;lead&nbsp;by example&nbsp;— that’s whether you’re a coach, whether you’re a teammate, whether you’re a spouse, a parent of a family,” she said. “The way that you’re going to be able to lead anyone is to&nbsp;first of all,&nbsp;lead&nbsp;by example yourself.&nbsp;Because that’s going to earn you the respect to&nbsp;actually have&nbsp;people listen.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum also noted that “owning up to your mistakes” is vital.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I shouldn’t be ashamed to talk about failing at my marriage and then getting remarried,” she told Us, referring to her relationship with husband <strong>Chris Aldama</strong>. “It’s a lesson that I&nbsp;learned&nbsp;and I grew from it.&nbsp;I became a better person because of it, and I think a lot of people —&nbsp;they don’t&nbsp;wanna&nbsp;accept blame&nbsp;or&nbsp;their mistakes, but really,&nbsp;when you take ownership of that, it earns you so much more respect when you say,&nbsp;‘I messed up. I’m sorry, I’m&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;do better.’ Whatever it is, just take ownership. I think that’s a lesson that we all need to learn and just being open to&nbsp;continuous self-growth.&nbsp;When you do those things, I feel like you become very powerful because what is someone&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;take away from you when you own your mistakes?”</p><p>With reporting by Shelby Stivale</p><p>Full Out is available now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSoppmYrm6ty52Yppldnby4ecKhnJ6qXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZiWu6W4xKxknKemnrFufZhmp5qmlJq6qq%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
