She insisted that they have never exchanged vows, are both single, and maintained a close friendship throughout the years.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Sunday (Dec. 31), Braxton took to social media to clear the air after reports surfaced speculating that she and the <a href=#>Cash Money Records founder</a> had wed in a private ceremony in Mexico. “My dear friend Birdman and I are not married… never been married,” the 56-year-old captioned a screenshot of a post congratulating the pair. “We are both single.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><br>Braxton’s sister, Tamar Braxton, also reacted to the rumors of Toni and Birdman jumping the broom, jokingly asking her followers on social media whether they had any information regarding the union.</figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I want to know!” Tamar declared in a short clip released on that same day. “I came here to ask y’all if she’s getting married. I don’t know! I been blowing up her phone… Somebody gotta tell us something. No, I’m being serious. Let me find out Toni Braxton got married before us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Braxton and Birdman have been romantically linked for more than a decade. Their relationship began as a professional one during the early aughts, as Birdman appeared on “Give It Back,” a song from <a href=#>Braxton’s 2002 album</a> More Than a Woman. Toni appeared on Birdman’s “Baby You Can Do It” that same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-543248882.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This isn’t the first time Braxton has debunked marriage rumors surrounding her and Birdman. In 2018, <a href=#>the renowned songstress</a> denied being wed to the rap mogul, a rumor that was sparked by Tamar Braxton. “Well, I am not married, unlike my big mouth sister Tamar has been saying everywhere!” <a href=# rel=nofollow>she said on Good Morning America</a> at the time. “I’m definitely not married yet, but we’re working together.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For his part, Birdman has been a bit more forthcoming regarding his bond with Braxton, referring to her as his “life” and a person he holds in high esteem. “T, that’s my girl, my friend, my family… That’s my love, my soldier, my life,” he said of Braxton during an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Wendy Williams</a>. “She’s my life. I love her to death.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-598663296.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8r7WMm6masKSku265wKupopmXmnqjtdGdpJqmXai2r7PLnmRqamNphXSDkm1taA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
