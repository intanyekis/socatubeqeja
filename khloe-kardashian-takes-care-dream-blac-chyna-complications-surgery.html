Yep, I did it again,” she wrote in a black-and-white video uploaded to Instagram. In the clip, Chyna was wearing a compression band on her upper chest, a part of her post surgery care. She sported a makeup-free face and hid her hair underneath a beanie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, earlier this year, I was like, 'You know what, I wanna take out my boobs. I'm over it I'm kinda tired of the fake look they're too big for my body, too big for my frame and it just doesn't fit me as a person anymore,’” she explained.</p><p>She proceeded to reveal that things took a turn for the worse soon after. "One of the worst things that could happen happened. One of my breasts got encapsulated," Chyna explained. "This is something that can happen whenever you do surgery."</p><p>Explaining what happened, the reality star her left breast muscle "had contracted around the implant," leading to intense pain. "All of the times I've had my breasts done, it's never happened," she added.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/all-the-kardashian-kids-in-order-from-oldest-to-youngest-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="All The Kardashian Kids In Order From Oldest To Youngest">All The Kardashian Kids In Order From Oldest To Youngest</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The next generation of the Kardashian-Jenner clan is growing up. From Kim's North West to Khloe's Tatum Thompson, these kids are already making waves.</p><p>Despite the experience, the mom-of-two says she doesn’t regret going under the knife. "All in all, though, I'm very very happy," Chyna concluded. "I'm excited because I'm finally part of the Itty Bitty Tittie Committee.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The short-term recovery from a breast reduction is usually 3 weeks, though in the long-term, it can take 3 to 6 mons for the body to fully heal. Chyna didn’t mention how the complications affected her recovery, including whether it kept her away from her children from longer than anticipated.</p><p>Chyna shares her youngest child, daughter Dream, with her ex-fiancé Rob Kardashian. Even though they reportedly split custody (after years of high-profile legal issues), reports have said Dream spends a lot of time with her aunt Khloe Kardashian, at least when she’s supposed to be in her father’s care.</p><h2 id=khloe-says-dream-is-with-her-most-of-the-time>Khloe Says Dream Is With Her Most Of The Time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kris-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Khloe seemed to imply Dream is with her</a> much of the time during a Keeping Up with the Kardashians episode, where the family reflected on the $100 million lawsuit Chyna brought against them (though it was later dismissed).</p><p>"She's suing us for over $100 million and we're leaving our fate in the hands of 12 random people, what if they hate us?" Khloe told her older sister Kim Kardashian on camera.</p><p>“Facts are facts; right is right, wrong is wrong,” she continued. “I’m not worried about something I’ve done, I’m just saying it’s going to be stressful and annoying.”</p><p>Khloe then exclaimed, “While she’s suing us, Dream’s at my house!”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">.Chyna recently settled a custody battle</a> with Tyga, whom she shares her older child, son King Cairo, 10, with. Though he was seeking primary custody, the exes agreed to split joint and legal custody. It’s unclear if Chyna’s custody situation with Rob is being challenged at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7bsDApJysZZOWv6Z5w6ucmqVdl7mir4ycn7KmkWKwsLnPpaCcmaSevK%2B%2FjKysq5%2BVp8Zw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
