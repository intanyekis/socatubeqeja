Losing the Super Bowl is not fun. Taking it from your brother has to be a bittersweet deal.”</p><p>Nick said that Joey is more “happy for him” than jealous that the brotherly scorecard is 2-0 in Super Bowl appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/Joey-Bosa.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kelce wants Chiefs to play in Spain</h2><p>The NFL announced this week it will play a regular-season game in Spain in 2025, and <a href=#>Kansas City star tight end Travis Kelce</a> made it clear he’d like the Chiefs to be one of the teams playing that game.</p><p>“It would be epic,’’ Kelce said. “It would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I’m going to go talk to [Chiefs owner] Clark Hunt right now about getting that bid in. Any chance that we can get as American football players to get out of the States to play internationally, I think you’d be silly not to jump at that opportunity.</p><p>“We had an amazing time in Germany this year, we’ve been to Mexico City, London. The fan bases are every bit as electric if not more from the United States. If the Chiefs get out to Spain, baby, we’ll make sure to have some fun.’’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reid: Experience helps in prep</h2><p>Chiefs coach Andy Reid has a specific plan for his players in the immediate lead-up to the Super Bowl, saying, “Experience does help,’’ having done this four times in the last five years. “We have a game plan for that,’’ Reid said. “We ask them to get off their feet, pump the brakes and relax so they don’t use all their energy. Then, with five minutes left [before going onto the field], get moving.’’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>McCaffrey has Olympic dream</h2><p>No one denies that Christian McCaffrey is one of the NFL’s most dynamic running backs. The 49ers star is a supreme athlete and does have a private desire, as far as his blazing speed.</p><p>“Winning a gold medal in the 100-meter dash, that would be one of the coolest things ever, because you’re the fastest man in the world, that would be awesome,’’ McCaffrey said. “I always wanted to run track, I always wanted to be much faster. I think when you get to that Olympic-level speed and you start to get to these college-level speeds, I don’t know a football player, there’s a couple of guys who can seriously run in the league but that’s a different level of speed. I think there’s just levels to every professional sport.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmamhfqL2wvtOsZqytoJq%2Fbq7OsKNmamBngW6uzqyYZpqipMGpsdGsZJynpaGxbq7EnKamnV2jsrnAjKScpZuVqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
