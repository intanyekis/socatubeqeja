Not only did the global icon speak on serious matters like mental health and battling Grave’s Disease, she also kept it light as she recalled filming the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234676853>groundbreaking 1997 music video</a> for “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly).”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elliott’s videos in the ’90s and early ’00s were a game changer and noticeably different from visuals released by her counterparts. While many other women who rap were <a href=# rel=nofollow>keeping it sexy</a> in their videos, or proving that they <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234700203>could go toe-to-toe with the boys</a>, the Hall of Famer was more focused on creating moments while having fun.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Missy’s inflated patent leather jumpsuit, vintage Alain Mikli shades, and perfectly sculpted finger waves immediately ring a bell when it comes to one of her most iconic videos. “I want to do everything that I say in the song,” Elliott recalled telling Hype Williams, who directed the video and is credited for her unforgettable look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screen-Shot-2023-06-20-at-12.11.30-PM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was having fun when doing the videos,”&nbsp;she told the outlet. “I never even thought,&nbsp;‘Let me try to do the most outlandish thing.’ That never crossed my mind, ever. It just spoke to who I was in school. For me to put on something to make me look even bigger than what I was, that was not the typical thing. Everything was kind of like a look back then. But, like I said, nothing is too outlandish for me.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rapping in a Jeep Wrangler, sitting atop a hill dressed in neon green, and wearing mono-colored ensembles can bring anyone back to that moment in Hip-Hop <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234714292>when videos were weird</a>, fun, and unlike anything you’ve seen before. Not to mention, the rapstress made space suits cool and also represented for the more voluptuous spitters in Hip-Hop.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was always just different,” she told the outlet. “So by the time I started doing videos, the music just really spoke to who I was as a person. And so I never thought,&nbsp;‘Hey, I’m going to do this, and this is going to change the world. It’s going to change the way videos look.’ Or&nbsp;‘I want to do the craziest thing ever.’ Nothing seemed crazy to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Revisit “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As she prepares to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234763402>take NOLA by storm next week</a>, the 51-year-old continues to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234749890>receive all of her flowers</a> — most recently being honored by the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234757140>National Museum Of African American&nbsp;Music</a>. This upcoming November, she will also be inducted into the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234753859>2023 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a>. Not only is this a major milestone in the music icon’s decades-long career, but she has now made history as the first woman who raps to garner the elite accolade.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the trailblazer’s trek, Elliott garnered four Grammy awards and created Platinum-selling albums, including&nbsp;Supa Dupa Fly, This Is Not A Test!, Da Real World, Miss E… So Addictive, The Cookbook,&nbsp;and the 2x multi-Platinum album,&nbsp;Under Construction. She has also had a <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234692416>street named after </a>her in her hometown of Portsmouth, Va.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As if she hasn’t accomplished enough, the MC has <a href=#>made “herstory”</a>&nbsp;as the first woman rapper and third rapper ever to be honored with a&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV Video Vanguard Award</a>&nbsp;and to be&nbsp;<a href=#>inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame</a>. The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>mother-of-two</a>&nbsp;also holds two honorary doctorates and the Woman’s Entrepreneurship Day Music Pioneer Award, presented by the United Nations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ready to take fans on a nostalgic journey through <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234757140>her illustrious career</a>, Missy Elliott will take the <a href=# id=auto-tag_essence data-tag=essence>ESSENCE</a> Festival stage as the headliner at the Caesars Superdome from June 29 to July 3 in New Orleans.
