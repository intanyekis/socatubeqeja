Be in a cage and dive with great white sharks #bucketlist,” the record-breaking athlete captioned a picture of a shark in the water below him as he stood on a cage.</p><p>Lochte also told reporters that Los Angeles is “always ready” for the Olympic Games, which may be held in the city again in 2024. The games first held in L.A. in 1932 and then again in 1984.</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=q2QER15kBTU%3Fecver%3D1</p><p>Lochte, who was charged with filing a false robery report when competing in 2016 Rio de Janerio Games, revealed that he isn’t sure if he’ll compete in the event. “That’s, like, eight years talking,” he said to TMZ. “I’ve got to worry about the next year.” However, the swimmer promised that he’s “definitely” making a splash in the 2020 games held in Tokyo.</p><p>The <i>Dancing With the Stars </i>alum and his fiancee, <b>Kayla Rae Reid</b>, <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a>, Caiden, in June. “I’m so f–king happy,” the new dad told reporters on Thursday, as he helped Reid, 26, into a waiting car.

The duo got engaged nine months later and have yet to set a wedding date.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Phelps vs. Shark</i> airs Sunday, July 23, at 8 p.m. E.T. on Discovery.
