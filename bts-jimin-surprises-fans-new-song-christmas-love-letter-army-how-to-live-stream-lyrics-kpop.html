Did you get a good Christmas present? I really wanted to hear from you, but fortunately, I am very, very happy to be able to do so. The reason I came here today is why I suddenly heard this bright song in this difficult situation, I came here because I wanted to tell you a little about the reason. As you can see from the contents of the song. This song is a scene where my favorite snow falls out of my childhood memories. I sing with my feelings when I first saw them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e9dfb861-8246-4cbc-85e9-8d3139f18b08.1192422130><p>&nbsp;<br>The ‘Friends’ crooner went on and said, “As we grow up, it seems that we miss our childhood a lot. Whether that’s the situation now or not, I thought I wanted to go back to that time. The responsibility of something you have as you grow, That responsibility makes us mature. I thought that it might make us hide our emotions a little.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jimin, known as the comforting angel, said, “All of you are always worthy of love. So, even if it’s a little shy than the usual expression. I hope there will be a situation where everyone can enjoy together. It’s a song that’s far short of what’s written in grandiose, I hoped that all of you would be happy people and made it hard with one wish. I hope I can go back to the old days that you remember a little bit after listening to the song.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Here’s how you can live stream the song</h2><p>Jimin’s Christmas Love is available to stream on YouTube, YouTube Music, and his letter to fans is attached to Soundcloud along with the track.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What’s the BTS Army’s reaction?</h2><p>Within 10 minutes of ‘Christmas Love’ dropping, the ‘Filter’ crooner started trending on Twitter with thousands of fans expressing love and thanking the BTS member for the most thoughtful Christmas present.
