In 2004, he filed a trademark application for the catchphrase "You're fired".</p><p>For the first year of the show, Trump was paid $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was&nbsp;reportedly earning&nbsp;$3 million per episode, making him one of the highest-paid TV personalities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald Trump was&nbsp;considered a possible candidate for President of the United States in 2012 but it wasn't until 2016 that President Trump actually defeated&nbsp;former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to become the 45th President of the United States. His promise to "Make America Great Again" resonated with enough voters to secure an electoral college victory; though, Trump lost the "popular vote".
