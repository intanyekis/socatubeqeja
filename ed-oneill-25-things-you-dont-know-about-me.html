Read on to learn 25 things about the host of “The Undercovers” podcast — including what he’d do if he weren’t an actor, the time he met <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> and how he learned he was main character in Finding Dory.</p><p>1. I was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 but was cut during training camp.</p><p>2. In high school [in Worthington, Ohio], after I won our football team a state championship, I was given the nickname “Ed O’Winner.”</p><p>3. Before I was an actor, I was a substitute high school [social studies] teacher.</p><p>4. I was one of the first students in the theater program at Youngstown State University.</p><p>5. My father and grandfather were steelworkers. I worked in a steel mill for four years.</p><p>6. I’m a black belt in jiujitsu and have been training for 22 years. Be very scared!</p><p>7. I’m starting a new venture: podcasting. I’m the narrator of “The Undercovers,” which covers incredible true stories about America’s fearless DEA agents.</p><p>8. I’m frequently cited as making my film debut in [1972’s] Deliverance, which is odd because I’m not in it!</p><p>9. I didn’t realize that I was a main character [Hank] in Finding Dory until I saw how many lines I had to record.</p><p>10. My star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located right in front of a shoe store — paying homage to [my Married… With Children character] Al Bundy and his shoe salesmanship.</p><p>11. I had issues with football in college because I much preferred to spend my time, uh, celebrating rather than working out. Or studying, for that matter!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ed-O-Neill-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-02.jpg><p>12. I wish I had a Super Bowl ring.</p><p>13. I created my own sandwich, “The Boone” at the Se-Port Deli in Setauket, New York.</p><p>14. I’m a long-standing member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.</p><p>15. I once won a national handball championship. Ed O’Winner strikes again!</p><p>16. My favorite memory on Modern Family was getting hired and working with [producer] <strong>Christopher Lloyd</strong> … What more could be said!</p><p>17. I once met Britney Spears and had no idea [who she was]!</p><p>18. If I weren’t an actor, I’d be an undercover agent. Former agents have told me I would’ve been a natural.</p><p>19. The biggest misconception about me is that I make plans for all my career moves. I really don’t, but I know when to say yes.</p><p>20. My worst personality trait? My love of talk shows.</p><p>21. Whenever I need to clear my mind, I like to spend time reading and cooking.</p><p>22. The most influential people in my life are my children. I want to ensure they’re taken care of, but it’s nice when they like me too.</p><p>23. The greatest piece of advice wasn’t given to me directly, but rather is a Confucius quote: “Life is simple, but we insist on making it complicated.”</p><p>24. I always go for it. When I was in my 30s, I got a bus ticket to New York. I knew it was what I wanted and where I was trying to go.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I’d never trade any of my experiences that led me to where I am today.</p><p>“The Undercovers” podcast is available now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaenF2ku6a1y6Vka21dqbWqusasZLKnpWKxsLrTZqKnp6dirqO71K1kpp1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
