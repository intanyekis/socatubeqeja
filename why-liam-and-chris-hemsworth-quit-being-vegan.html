In addition to having such crazy and extensive workouts, they also pay very close attention to their diets. They both have experimented with vegan diets, and it appears they've had pretty good success. But how has going vegan affected their ability to get roles?At first glance, an actor going vegan shouldn't really affect their fame in any way. However, because of the importance of their body appearance, there really might be repercussions for the diets they choose. Here's everything to know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-movies-has-chris-hemworth-gone-vegan-for><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Movies Has Chris Hemworth Gone Vegan For?</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth has converted to a vegan diet at multiple points throughout his career. Specifically, he's gone vegan for the movies Thor and the 2012 Avengers film, two of the many movies where he played the God of Thunder.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth And Elsa Pataky's Wedding Was Very Unusual For Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Chris also went vegan when filming for Avengers: Endgame. He even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trained with famous vegan Torre Washington</a>. Beyond that, he hasn't gone solely vegan when filming for specific roles. However, there was one time when he converted to vegan - for just a day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was the case for Thor: Love And Thunder. He was filming a kiss scene that day with Natalie Portman, who is famous for being vegan since she was 9 years old. Aside from that day, Chris stuck to his regular mixed diet - albeit <a href=#>a more intense version of it</a>.</p><h2 id=is-liam-hemsworth-still-a-vegan><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Is Liam Hemsworth Still A Vegan?</span></h2><p>While Chris has gone vegan at sporadic points throughout his career, Liam became vegan for a solid period of time. This started in 2015 but then ended at some point in 2019. The reason for that is because of a kidney stone that doctors found, which Liam believes actually stemmed from his vegan diet. He did state that the vegan diet made him feel "great", but this was years before he had the kidney stone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-roles-has-chris-hemsworth-lost-out-on><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Roles Has Chris Hemsworth Lost Out On?</span></h2><p>Chris has primarily lost out on two roles throughout his career, and none of them seemingly have to do with him being vegan.</p><p>Chris has stated in interviews that he auditioned for undisclosed roles for the X-Men and GI: Joe franchises. This was before he won the role as Thor. Now, it seems there isn't a role Chris can't get.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Dave Bautista And Chris Hemsworth?</a></span></p><p>As for his diet, his roles in Thor and The Avengers have proved that someone can be a vegan and still be pretty ripped. He hasn't ever explained why, despite how ripped he is, he hasn't fully converted to vegan. Perhaps he fears he'll lose out on future roles because of his diet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-liam-hemsworth-quit-being-vegan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Did Liam Hemsworth Quit Being Vegan?</span></h2><p>While going vegan hasn't forced Liam to lose any roles, it has still affected his film career. In 2019, Liam actually passed a kidney stone. His kidney stone did affect his press tour for his film Isn't It Romantic. Liam claims this as the reason for finally ending his vegan diet.</p><p>A famous role that Liam did lose out on <a href=#>happened to be Thor</a> - his brother's most iconic role.</p><h2 id=here-s-how-much-money-chris-hemworth-made-from-his-fitness-app-centr><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Here's How Much Money Chris Hemworth Made From His Fitness App Centr</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both of these brothers have actually invested a lot of their money into their diet and exercise routines. Chris has even created an app called Centr, which is described by the company as a "digital fitness platform". It <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was bought by Jeff Bezo's brother Mark</a> for an evaluation of over $200 million.</p><p>Chris Hemsworth actually has a total net worth of $130 million. His most expensive purchase is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his giant Byron Bay mansion</a>, and who knows how else Chris will spend his fortune in the future. Regardless, both of these brothers spend as much money as they possibly can on getting the best dietitians and exercise equipment.</p><h2 id=what-roles-do-liam-and-chris-have-in-the-future><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Roles Do Liam And Chris Have In The Future?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed for a while that Chris and his career could go nowhere but up. After Thor: Love And Thunder, Chris seemed slated to appear as Thor in more Marvel movies. According to IGN, however, if he does return, it will be because the MCU writers "close the book" on Thor's story arc. As sad as that would be for fans, something even sadder has come out about Chris. He recently announced <a href=#>he has a risk for Alzheimer's disease</a>, and will take a break from acting.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Henry Cavill Doesn't Follow Chris Hemsworth's Thor Diet Of Eating 10 Meals Per Days, He Eats Less Than Half Of That</a></span></p><p>Liam, meanwhile, is making another shot at blockbuster acting with his appearance in the Witcher show. He's starring as the main character Geralt. That does mean he has replaced Henry Cavill, whose apparent disappearance from the show might be because of his return as Superman.</p><p>Regardless, it seems that both of these brothers are about to start a new chapter in their life journeys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobaiuYyapZ1lk52%2Fqr%2BMoZymq6ekv7W0jKqsoqxdl7KqusZmrZ6fkaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
