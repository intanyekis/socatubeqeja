The actress doesn’t even seem to have a boyfriend, much less a spouse. Calliope Maeve, Felicia Day’s first child, was born in January 2017. Using a photo of the little girl’s tiny feet on Twitter, she revealed the exciting news.</p><p>Felicia continued that day by writing in a different tweet,</p><p>Last week, I went into the hospital to give birth, and when I walked out, I had forgotten where I was from.</p><p>Early in January, the Guild actress revealed her pregnancy on Instagram. Adding a caption to the selfie,</p><p>She’s arriving in about three weeks, so I suppose I should make the announcement and everything.</p><p>On Twitter, the actress disclosed the source of her daughter’s name. Maeve was an Irish mythological princess, but Calliope is a muse who rules over classical poetry. On her many social media pages, the delighted mother often posts gorgeous pictures of herself and her young daughter.</p><p>Day has not yet disclosed her daughter’s biological father. Nobody is certain yet whether she gave birth to her child naturally or through artificial insemination.</p><p>She and her child presently reside in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2><span id=Felicia_Day_briefly_dated_Nathan_Fillion_as_her_boyfriend>Felicia Day briefly dated Nathan Fillion as her boyfriend.</span></h2><p>Felicia Day was formerly romantically linked to Firefly actor Nathan Fillion, but she is still pretty good at keeping her relationship out of the spotlight. Despite never publicly addressing the relationship rumors, the two’s regular public outings suggested that something was obviously going on between them.</p><p>In 2008, the pair collaborated on the web series Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog, which was likely their first professional gig together. Day had already made a number of public appearances with her then-rumored beau Fillion.</p><p>On April 14, 2009, the pair was spotted together at PaleyFest09’s “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog” at the ArcLight in California. In addition, on October 10, 2015, they went to the “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog Reunion” at PaleyFest New York.</p><p>Felicia and Nathan have never disclosed the precise date of their relationship’s start or duration. Together once more, the two collaborated on the comedy-drama series The Rookie, in which Fillion has been starring as John Nolan since 2018.</p><p>Remarkably, neither Day nor Fillion are seeing anyone right now. However, the actor has dated other women in the past.</p><p>In Husbands, Felicia Day played a seductive pizza girl.</p><p>Felicia Day debuted in the online series Husbands in 2012 as the seductive Pizza Girl. Brad Bell and Jane Espenson wrote and developed it.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Mahbod Moghadam, Kwhxte, and Renata Jara."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":40,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":51}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/mahbod-moghadam/"}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/kwhxte/"}{"1":34}{"1":40,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/renata-jara/"}{"1":51}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kwhxte</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Renata Jara</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Nathan Dales | Professional Life</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Drita D’Avanzo | Husband | Relationship</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfm7KttcKimGacka56qcHSm5innF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
