However, it wasn’t until later that year that Cory learned the baby was his child. The exes have since weathered many storms while raising their daughter.</p><p>“I think we definitely showcase our coparenting a lot more this season and how we all make this work and rely on each other,” Cheyenne told Us. “I feel, like, it’s cool to see, even when two [of us] are going through a hard time, how the other two show up for them. I just wanna see how it plays out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a> season 2 premieres on MTV Wednesday, July 19, with back-to-back episodes starting at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxknKCVrrKvusRmnaWnqZl6pbHTmqClq12nvLazx2anmqyTnbK0ecKop5qqlaPBqrrGZq6irJhisLC%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
