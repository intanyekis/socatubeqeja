This caused some pretty nasty backlash, which only got harsher with every tweet she made to defend herself. The actress was known for battling depression, leading many to attribute the backlash from her tweet to pushing her over the edge.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>ADULT FILM STARS THAT MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES</a></strong></p><p>‘Whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow...you’re shooting with a guy who has shot gay p*rn,” reads the tweet, “BS is all I can say.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ames went on to state that she refused to work the shoot because of safety concerns. This only drew more backlash from fans and other performers alike, with many saying that every performer is tested, meaning her concerns are not very warranted. Still, she stuck with her argument, saying it’s her body and she decides what she does with it. Ironically enough, Ames was outwardly bisexual, leading many to call her a hypocrite.</p><p>Her last tweet read "f*ck yall."</p><p>Ames was only 23 years old but accomplished quite a bit in the world of adult films. Appearing in 270 flicks since her debut in 2013, she was even a nominee for performer of the year for 2018.</p><p>Ames, whose real name is Mercedes Grabowski, was born in Nova Scotia, Canada.
