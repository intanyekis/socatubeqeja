Now, it appears film memorabilia collectors are looking to cash in on the positive publicity – starting with the Harley Johnny rode in the1990 cult classic Cry Baby.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the 1955 Harley Davidson Model K is going up for sale courtesy of Kruse GWS Auctions. The bidding will start at $250,000 and interested buyers will be able to bid in $25,000 increments to secure the bike.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Rocks $100,000 Choker & Custom Versace Dress For Wedding</a></span></p><p>The publication notes that the price may appear “steep” for a Harley, even a film famous one, but the defamation case has likely driven up the price.</p><p>The Harley was the main bike used in photography and filming for the movie, which took place in Maryland and Hollywood. Though the bike has had numerous owners in the last few decades, it currently sits in a museum in Branson, Missouri.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The auction will feature other memorabilia from famous faces, including Janis Joplin’s mandolin, which she received from Jimi Hendrix. The instrument has been in a private collection for two decades, and this will make the first time it’s up for auction. Bidding will start at $250,000.</p><p>The auction <a href=#>officially opens on June 25</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, a jury determined that Amber had defamed her ex-husband in three separate statements in the 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described surviving abuse.</p><p>Johnny was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages as well as $5 million in punitive damages. However, due to a Virginia rule capping punitive damages, the Aquaman actress will only have to pay $10.35 million – though her legal team has said she “absolutely” can’t afford the damages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber originally <a href=#>countersued Johnny for $100 million</a> (double what he was seeking) after his attorney called her allegations a “hoax,” which she claimed was an act of defamation.</p><p>The jury did agree Amber had been defamed by the lawyer’s statement, thus awarding her $2 million in compensatory damages.</p><p>Last week, <a href=#>a GoFundMe page popped up</a> claiming to be raising funds to help Amber pay damages to Johnny. It called itself “Justice for Amber Heard.”</p><p>"The trial was a disgrace. I believe Amber, and social media protected the abuser,” the fundraiser’s description said. “The judgment exceeds her net worth. It's so sad that he was able to get away with the abuse. The judgment furthers that abuse. If you can please help her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, GoFundMe eventually took down the fundraiser, explaining they determined it wasn’t a legitimate campaign.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Geico Must Pay Woman $5.2 Million After Contracting STI In Insured Car</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>The News</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8mon6emqWKxprzPZpqrsV2XrqPFjKGYq6SVrnquu9OoqZyxk6Gybq3UnKuip55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
