At the time of this writing, Florence Pugh is doing all the right things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress is brilliant in every movie she's in, and she's a fixture in the <a href=#>MCU</a>. Now that she's <a href=#>proven herself in the franchise</a>, other franchises <a href=#>have come knocking</a>, and her career will continue to skyrocket.</p><p>Pugh will be starring in Don't Worry Darling, and recently, rumors about a feud with the film's director, Olivia Wilde, have circulated. Let's see what's going on between the duo,</p><h2 id=florence-pugh-has-exploded-in-popularity>Florence Pugh Has Exploded In Popularity</h2><p>If you're a movie fan, then you've likely noticed that Florence Pugh is a rising star in Hollywood. She's been taking the world by storm in recent years, and given the fact that she always turns in a great performance, Pugh's star will continue to rise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After turning in good performances for a few years, Pugh really hit her stride and broke out with her performance in Midsommar, which was a critical and commercial success. She managed to steal the show in the movie, and suddenly, people saw what she could do when given the right opportunity.</p><p>After following up Midsommar with Little Women, Pugh was off and running, and she managed to take things to another level with Black Widow. Her debut MCU offering might not have been one of the franchise's best films, but Pugh stole the show, and after appearing on Hawkeye, fans want more of her immediately.</p><p>Now that she's as popular as ever, Pugh's plate is filled with upcoming projects.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jessica Chastain Had Strong Feelings About Florence Pugh's 'Revealing' Dress</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pugh-is-starring-in-39-don-39-t-worry-darling-39>Pugh Is Starring In 'Don't Worry Darling'</h2><p>Later this year, Pugh will be starring in Don't Worry Darling, a film directed by OIivia Wilde, and co-starring Harry Styles. It's generated a considerable amount of buzz over the months, and the previews did an exceptional job in selling the film.</p><p>For Pugh, this is another major release, and one that could continue to build up her growing fan base. It also gives her a chance to shine alongside Styles, who has done well in acting, despite being best known for his music.</p><p>Styles' casting came on the heels of Shia LaBeouf's firing, and Wilde herself admitted that getting the casting right was difficult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No joke, it is harrrrrd to find actors who recognize why it might be worth it to allow for a woman to hold the spotlight. Not only did he relish the opportunity to allow for the brilliant Florence Pugh to hold center stage as our ‘Alice’, but he infused every scene with a nuanced sense of humanity," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p>This film seems poised to do some great things later this year, but at the moment, it's dealing with a thorn in its side.

Allegedly, it stems from Wilde's relationship with Pugh's co-star, Harry Styles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Jezebel, "For Olivia Wilde, Florence Pugh, and Harry Styles, it’s the fact that Pugh is not a fan of Wilde and Styles’ relationship—particularly because it likely began when Wilde was still with her ex-fiancé, Jason “Ted Lasso” Sudeikis, who is a close friend of Pugh’s boyfriend, Zach Braff."</p><p>That's the rumor that's spreading right now, and the Internet has been running with it for some time. Sleuths have tried connecting some dots, namely that Pugh has done little in the way of marketing Don't Worry Darling on social media.</p><p>However, new sources have been combating these rumors.</p><p>"I can tell you for a fact that Flo seeing Olivia and Harry all over each other on set did not go down well as Olivia was still with Jason when she first hooked up with Harry," one source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the marketing issue has little to do with a feud.</p><p>"I heard she was already scheduled to post [about ‘Oppenheimer’] that day for some specific reason, it had nothing to do with a response to Olivia," a source told Page Six.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zach Braff Declares His Girlfriend Florence Pugh Is One Of The 'Best Actresses'</a></span></p><p>At the end of the day, this could all end up being a big misunderstanding.
